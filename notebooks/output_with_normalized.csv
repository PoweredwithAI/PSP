Obesity promotes ARDS by modulating ceramide transfer protein-ceramide pathway and exacerbating oxidative stress/apoptosis in alveolar macrophages,"Obesity is an independent risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the precise pathway through which obesity amplifies the severity of ARDS remains elusive. Our study embarked on a comprehensive analysis focusing on alterations in the proteomic and metabolomic landscapes of lung tissue extracted from high-fat diet (HFD) mice afflicted with lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury. This approach was designed to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the exacerbated pulmonary response in obesity-related ARDS. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism may be involved in the exacerbation of lung injury associated with obesity. Specifically, pulmonary ceramide transfer protein (CERT) expressions were reduced in patients with obesity and HFD mice, while Cer levels were increased. Similarly, co-culture with 3T3-L1 cells reduced CERT expression and increased ceramide (Cer) levels in MH-S cells. Furthermore, overexpression of CERT in vivo and in vitro enhanced Cer transport, leading to reduced Cer levels and, subsequently, a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammatory damage in mouse lung tissues and alveolar macrophages. Conversely, CERT knockdown yielded the opposite effect. Moreover, exogenous ceramide supplementation reversed these protective effects conferred by CERT overexpression. In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that obesity-induced downregulation of CERT reduced Cer transport, increased Cer levels, and aggravated ARDS through elevated ROS production and apoptosis. Taken together, these results highlight CERT may represent a promising therapeutic target for managing ARDS in individuals with obesity.",2025,"['pulmonary ceramide transfer protein', 'cert', 'cer', 'cert', 'cert', 'cer', 'cer', 'cert', 'cert', 'cert', 'cer', 'cer', 'cert']","['cert', 'cer']"
Adipose Tissue as a Target for Precision Medicine Approaches in Childhood Obesity.,"Following the trends of the adult obesity epidemic, and worsened by school disruptions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, childhood obesity prevalence has reached unprecedented levels. The health implications for this generation are especially concerning, as childhood-onset obesity has more severe health consequences than weight gain that begins in adulthood, including increased risk of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related complications. The complexity of obesity treatment has been challenging, including remarkable heterogeneity in obesity phenotypes and treatment responses among both adults and children. Many in the field have therefore highlighted a need for precision medicine approaches in obesity treatment across age-groups. This includes a need for precision risk stratification to better target treatment intensity, which will require a better understanding of the earliest stages of metabolic syndrome pathophysiology. The health, function, and distribution of adipose tissue have been established as important determinants of metabolic health in both childhood- and adult-onset obesity, making adipose tissue a promising target for understanding phenotypic heterogeneity in obesity. Here, we provide a brief overview of the current limited understanding of adipose tissue biology during childhood development and discuss opportunities for further research into adipose-centric precision medicine approaches in childhood-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes.<h4>Article highlights</h4>Treatment options for childhood obesity are expanding, but precision medicine approaches, including strategies for precision risk assessment, are needed to appropriately target treatment intensity. Parameters of adipose tissue dysfunction are better predictors of metabolic syndrome than body size, and therefore adipose tissue represents a prime candidate for research approaches in understanding the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and in identifying biomarkers of future prognosis. Expanded developmental research on pediatric adipose tissue in both mice and humans is needed to understand the pathophysiology of childhood-onset obesity and to develop precision treatment approaches.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
A blueprint of synergistic effect in Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota against obesity via systems biology concept.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current obesity treatments include behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy and surgery. Recently, the combination of 'medicinal food' products such as the plant Crataegus pinnatifida and its interaction with the gut microbiota has shown promise as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained secondary metabolites (SMs) of obesity-related gut microbiota and Crataegus pinnatifida from gutMGene database and NAPSS database. bioinformatics analysis was used to elucidate key target and signaling pathways, whereas molecular docking (MD), molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemical calculations identified crucial SMs involved in these pathways. The toxicity and physicochemical properties of these SMs were also assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), a key mediator in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Protein Kinase B (Akt) pathway that is crucial for regulating insulin signaling and adipogenesis, emerged as the central hub within the PPI network. Strong binders to PIK3R1 were predicted to be quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin chalcone, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents to treat obesity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The synergistic combination of Crataegus pinnatifida and the obesity-related gut microbiota holds promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity by targeting PIK3R1 and modulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Further experimental validation is necessary to confirm these findings.",2025,"['phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase regulatory subunit 1', 'pik3r1', 'phosphoinositide 3 - kinase', 'pi3k', 'protein kinase b', 'a', '##kt', 'insulin', 'ppi', 'pik3r1', 'pik3r1', 'pi3k', 'akt']","['pik3r1', 'phosphoinositide 3 kinase', 'pi3k', 'protein kinase b', 'insulin', 'ppi', 'akt']"
Nanomaterials for the treatment and monitoring of obesity: Targeting adipose tissue macrophages.,"Obesity represents a growing global health crisis, closely associated with chronic low-grade inflammation driven by the recruitment and polarization of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Targeting ATMs to suppress adipose inflammation has emerged as a promising strategy for obesity treatment. However, conventional anti-inflammatory therapies are hindered by poor tissue specificity and systemic side effects. In recent years, advances in nanotechnology have enabled the development of multifunctional nanomaterials capable of modulating ATM behavior with improved precision and efficacy. This review presents the first comprehensive synthesis of multimodal nano-based strategies for targeting ATMs in obesity, integrating both therapeutic and monitoring applications. We begin by elucidating the immunological roles of ATMs in the pathogenesis of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. We then outline rational design principles for ATM-targeted nanomaterials, followed by an in-depth analysis of representative organic and inorganic nanomedicines, including emerging platforms such as gene-editing systems and combination nanotherapies. Furthermore, we summarize recent developments in nano-enabled imaging strategies for non-invasive monitoring of adipose tissue inflammation. Finally, we critically discuss the key challenges-such as off-target effects and translational barriers-and propose future research directions. By bridging advances in nanomedicine and immunometabolism, this review fills a significant gap in the literature and provides a forward-looking perspective for the clinical translation of ATM-targeted nanotherapies in obesity management. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Obesity is a major global health burden, strongly linked to chronic low-grade inflammation mediated by adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). While ATMs represent a promising immunotherapeutic target, effective strategies for their precise modulation remain limited. Recent advances in nanotechnology have opened new avenues for selectively targeting ATMs. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews integrating nanomedicine with ATM biology in the context of obesity. This review fills that critical gap by systematically summarizing design strategies for ATM-targeted nanomaterials, evaluating their therapeutic and monitoring applications, and outlining current challenges and future directions. By bridging nano-immunotherapy and metabolic disease, this work provides timely insights to guide innovation in obesity treatment and monitoring.",2025,[],[]
Reflection of therapy progress in virtual reality for individuals affected by obesity: a pilot study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Obesity is a major health challenge, requiring the development of more effective interventions. Setting realistic goals and developing detailed plans that anticipate potential challenges can be helpful strategies for bridging the intention-behavior gap. Immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), are considered to further support closing this gap by reducing the distance to one's future self.<h4>Methods</h4>This study investigates a novel VR-supported reflection exercise as an additional treatment module within a conservative obesity treatment regime. It examines its feasibility, acceptance and short- and medium-term effects on participants' therapy motivation, body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and eating behavior. 23 participants (BMI: M = 43.44 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, SD = 4.42) were presented with a real-time animated body avatar that had the average body shape for their individual height, initial weight, and realistic target weight (- 10%), and standard appearance matched in terms of hair and skin color. The avatar could be viewed from first-person and mirror perspectives. The exercise included reflective questions about their experience, well-being, daily life, and eating and movement behavior.<h4>Results</h4>Participation and dropout rates of the VR-supported reflection exercise, user experience ratings, assessments on general discomfort and qualitative feedback demonstrated good feasibility and acceptance of the VR exercise. There were no measurable effects of a single session on clinical outcomes, including motivation to change, eating disorder psychopathology, self-esteem and depressive symptoms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The VR-based reflection exercise was feasible and well-accepted. The sample was highly burdened with multimorbidity, severe obesity (grade III), and psychological stress. A clinical trial with sufficient dosage would be required to infer about clinical effects.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level 4.",2025,[],[]

Exploring the anti-obesity potential of Ailanthus excelsa Roxb in vitro enzymatic inhibition and computational pharmacology insights.,"This study explores the potential of Ailanthus excelsa Roxb. for managing obesity by evaluating its effects on key metabolic enzymes. We evaluated a hydroalcoholic extract and its fractions for their ability to modulate important metabolic enzymes, porcine pancreatic lipase, HMG-CoA reductase, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase activities. Our methodology integrated in vitro enzymatic assays with cluster analysis (MCODE, ClueGO, and Cluepedia) and network pharmacology to elucidate interactions between metabolites and target enzymes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, consisting of a network with 51 nodes and 264 edges, was performed using the CytoNCA plugin to calculate topological parameters. Key targets were identified based on degree centrality, including ADIPOQ, PPARA, PPARG, IL6, TNF, and AKT1. Cluster analysis of the PPI networks, conducted using the MCODE plugin, highlighted a top cluster with a high score of 22.82. Network pharmacology has identified key targets associated with obesity, including HK1, HK2, PIK3CA, AKT1, MTOR, CD36, ACACB, SLC2A4, CPTIA, INSR, ACACA, FASN, and ADIPOQ. These targets are linked to highly modulated metabolic pathways. Isoquercetin shows significant binding affinities: - 7.11 for HMG-CoA Reductase (PDB ID: 1HW9), -9.96 for lipase (PDB ID: 1LPB), - 8.96 for α-amylase, and - 10.41 for α-Glucosidase (PDB ID: 3A47). The ethyl acetate fractions exhibit notable inhibition of Porcine Pancreatic lipase (IC<sub>50</sub>: 56.25 ± 4.85 µg/mL) and HMG-CoA reductase (IC<sub>50</sub>: 108.27 ± 3.38 µg/mL), α-glucosidase (IC<sub>50</sub>: 117.08 ± 3.28 µg/mL), and α-amylase (IC<sub>50</sub>: 125.93 ± 2.29 µg/mL). Moreover, metabolites showed stronger binding affinities to all four enzymes than reference molecules. By integrating in vitro assays with molecular modeling, this study highlights the promising potential of A. excelsa and its fractions in obesity management, offering valuable insights into its therapeutic applications.",2025,"['porcine pancreatic lipase', 'hmg - coa reductase', 'α - glucosidase', 'α - amylase', 'ppara', 'pparg', 'il6', 'tnf', 'akt1', 'hk1', 'hk2', 'pik3ca', 'akt1', 'mtor', 'cd36', 'acacb', 'slc2a4', 'cptia', 'insr', 'acaca', 'fasn', 'isoquercetin', 'hmg - coa reductase', 'pdb id :', '1hw9', 'lipase', 'pdb id :', '1lpb', 'α - amylase', 'α - glucosidase', 'pdb id : 3a47', 'porcine pancreatic lipase', 'hmg - coa reductase', 'α - glucosidase', 'i', 'α - amylase']","['hmg coa reductase', 'ppara', 'pparg', 'il6', 'tnf', 'akt1', 'hk1', 'hk2', 'pik3ca', 'mtor', 'cd36', 'acacb', 'slc2a4', 'insr', 'acaca', 'fasn', 'isoquercetin', 'lipase']"
"In Silico exploration of Karanjin for anti-obesity potential through ADMET profiling, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations.","Obesity is a growing public health concern, particularly in Malaysia, where prevalence rates continue to rise. Despite the availability of pharmacological interventions, existing anti-obesity drugs are often limited by modest efficacy and undesirable side effects. Natural compounds have emerged as promising alternatives, offering multi-target therapeutic potential with improved safety profiles. Karanjin, a furanoflavonoid isolated from Pongamia pinnata, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but its role in obesity management remains largely unexplored. In this study, an integrated in silico method was employed to explore the anti-obesity potential of Karanjin. Pharmacokinetic profiling indicated favourable absorption, distribution, and toxicity profiles. Network pharmacology analysis identified 145 overlapping targets between Karanjin and obesity-related genes, with enriched significant pathways such as AGE-RAGE signalling, which is implicated in oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation. Molecular docking against eight hub proteins revealed strong binding affinities, with Karanjin exhibiting superior binding energies compared to reference anti-obesity drugs. Notably, the PIK3CA-Karanjin complex demonstrated the most favourable interaction profile. Confirmed molecular dynamics simulations results in a stable structure of the PIK3CA-Karanjin complex in a span of 100 ns, supported by root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) analyses. Binding free energy calculations using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) method further validated the thermodynamic favourability of the interaction. Collectively, the findings provide a strong computational foundation supporting the potential of Karanjin as a multi-target candidate for obesity management, warranting further experimental validation.",2025,"['pik3ca', 'karanjin', 'pik3ca', 'karan']","['pik3ca', 'karanjin']"
Association of a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet during pregnancy with offspring growth and obesity until the age of 18 years - a target trial emulation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with offspring obesity. Moreover, maternal dietary patterns, particularly protein intake and glycemic index, influence GWG and fetal development. This study aimed to investigate the association of a high-protein, low-glycemic-index (HPLGI) diet during pregnancy with offspring growth and obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Using observational data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, a target trial emulation was conducted to investigate the association of an HPLGI diet during pregnancy on offspring growth up to 18 years of age. A cohort of 17,551 women who met the inclusion criteria was categorized into exposure groups based on their protein intake and glycemic index to emulate the groups in the APPROACH trial.<h4>Results</h4>Maternal characteristics varied between the exposure groups, with the HPLGI women exhibiting 1.67 kg higher pre-pregnancy weight and 0.49 kg/m<sup>2</sup> BMI, with no differences in GWG. Offspring outcomes were assessed at various ages, and a linear mixed model was used, including potential confounders. Offspring born to women following an HPLGI diet during pregnancy had 2.59 kg higher body weight and 0.72 kg/m<sup>2</sup> higher BMI at 18 years compared to those from the moderate-protein, moderate-glycemic-index (MPMGI) group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>An HPLGI diet during pregnancy was associated with higher offspring body weight and BMI at 18 years of age compared to an MPMGI diet. These findings suggest that maternal dietary composition during pregnancy may have long-term implications for offspring growth and obesity risk, underscoring the importance of evaluating dietary recommendations during pregnancy.",2025,[],[]

m6A methylation - a new target of metabolic diseases induced by environmental pollutants.,"Exposure to environmental pollutants is closely associated with the development of obesity and related metabolic diseases. As the most prevalent form of eukaryotic chemical modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation regulated by series enzymes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), atherosclerosis (AS), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therefore, investigating the specific mechanisms of m6A methylation in obesity and related metabolic diseases and its relationship with environmental pollutants is vital for developing treatment and prevention strategies. This article summarizes the latest research on m6A methylation in glucose and lipid metabolism-related diseases and elucidates the specific molecular mechanisms of metabolic disorders regulated by m6A methylation-related enzymes. More importantly, we highlight that m6A methylation process is a target for environmental pollutants in inducing human metabolic diseases. Our review aims to provide new insights into understanding the underlying mechanisms of environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases and to explore preventive and therapeutic measures.",2025,[],[]
A glimpse into the pipeline of anti-obesity medication development: combining multiple receptor pathways.,"Obesity has been historically a stubborn chronic metabolic disease, resistant to multiple therapeutic modalities. Although effective in the short-term for some people, lifestyle interventions have proven difficult to maintain in the long-term. Metabolic bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for durable weight loss and improvement of obesity-related conditions but is invasive and vastly underutilized. For decades, patients and clinicians confronted a wide gap between lifestyle modification and bariatric procedures. Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy was plagued by either safety concerns or very modest effectiveness. Recently, the availability of highly effective medications has given patients living with obesity hope for better health. These advances represent a culmination of many years of scientific progress regarding our understanding of human weight regulation and the beginning of a new era in treating metabolic diseases. In fact, many molecules are under investigation for obesity therapy, some with novel mechanisms. Since data on these putative agents are appearing at accelerated speed, the aim of this review is to provide an updated synopsis of emerging agents, highlighting the correlation between efficacy and combination strategies.",2025,[],[]

Association between body weight time in target range and risk of type 2 diabetes in adults with obesity,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the need for effective weight management strategies for its prevention and control. This study evaluated the association between body weight time in the target range (TTR) and the risk of type 2 diabetes in adults with obesity. Methods Using the 2010–2022 Korean National Health Insurance Service database, 248,367 obese participants with no history of diabetes were included. Body weight TTR was defined as the proportion of time maintaining a ≥ 3% reduction from baseline body weight. Participants were categorized into body weight TTR groups of 0%, > 0–50%, and > 50–100%. The primary outcome was the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results During a median follow-up period of 5.6 years, 46,737 (18.8%) of the 248,367 individuals with obesity developed type 2 diabetes. Compared to individuals with TTR = 0%, those with TTR > 0–50% and > 50–100% exhibited significantly lower risks of type 2 diabetes, with adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84–0.88) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.64–0.67), respectively. A 10% increase in body weight TTR was significantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (aHR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.95–0.96) after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion In adults with obesity, a higher body weight TTR was significantly associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of sustained weight management in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>",2025,[],[]
Single-Pill Combination of Perindopril-Indapamide-Amlodipine in Hypertensive Patients with Obesity: Long-Term Efficacy,"<h4>Background: </h4> and Objectives: Treatment of patients with arterial hypertension (H) associated with abdominal obesity (O) is complex and most often requires the use of several antihypertensive agents. The purpose of the work: to evaluate the advantages of the single pill combination (SPC) of perindopril (P), indapamide (I) and amlodipine (A) in comparison with their free combination (FC) in achieving effective control of H for a long time in patients with O. <h4>Materials and Methods:</h4> Seventy five patients (of which 45 men) with uncontrolled H associated with O (age 48-66 years) were examined. Among patients included in the study, 45 received a FC of P, I and A, and 36 - SPC of these drugs. The drugs were used once a day in the following daily doses: P-4-8 mg, I-1.25-2.5 mg and A-5-10 mg. Patients were followed up for 12 months. <h4>Results:</h4> SPC of P,I and A were significantly more effective than FC in hypertensive patients with O. The high efficiency of SPC persisted for a long time (over 12 months) and associated with significantly increased adherence to therapy in comparison with FC. To achieve target BP levels with SPC, lower doses of drugs were required than with FC. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> The single pill combination of P, I and A shows greater efficiency than FC, and makes it possible to maintain BP within the target levels for a long time with lower doses of drugs.",2025,[],[]
Treat to target in weight management with semaglutide: Real-world evidence from an eHealth clinic.,"<h4>Aims</h4>To evaluate the effectiveness of an online multidisciplinary weight loss service combining individualised semaglutide dosing with intensive behavioural therapy (IBT) in adults living with overweight or obesity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study included data from Danish participants enrolled in a digital weight loss programme via the Embla app between January 2022 and September 2024. The programme offered semaglutide with personalised dosing alongside evidence-based recommendations on nutrition, exercise and habits, delivered through IBT. All data collection and monitoring was conducted via the Embla app. The primary outcome was percentage change in body weight at week 64. Secondary outcomes included semaglutide dose, proportions achieving ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, or ≥20% weight loss, and weight change by baseline BMI and dose.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 2694 participants (78% women, mean age 46.8 ± 10.8 years, mean BMI 34.3 ± 4.8). At weeks 26, 52, and 64, the number of participants that remained in the study was: 1580, 712, and 465. Mean weight loss at week 64 was 16.7% (95% CI: -17.4 to -16.0) with a mean semaglutide dose of 1.08 mg/week (SD 0.54). A total of 98% achieved ≥5% and 82% achieved ≥10% weight loss. Weight change was consistent across BMI classes and medication doses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Participants achieved clinically meaningful weight loss comparable to that seen in randomised trials, despite using lower semaglutide doses. These findings support the effectiveness of a personalised, treat-to-target approach integrating medical and behavioural obesity management in a digital setting.<h4>Trial registration</h4>https://osf.io/86kmc/.",2025,[],[]
Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with obesity: A target trial emulation study.,"<h4>Aims</h4>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) provide cardiovascular and renal benefits in type 2 diabetes, but their real-world effects in individuals with obesity without diabetes are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of GLP-1RAs versus other anti-obesity medications (AOMs) in adults with obesity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This target trial emulation used TriNetX electronic health records (July 2021-May 2025) to identify adults with obesity and no diabetes history who initiated GLP-1RAs (liraglutide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide) or other AOMs. Outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse kidney events (MAKE), all-cause mortality, mental health conditions, and safety outcomes. Propensity score matching (1:1) balanced baseline characteristics; Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<h4>Results</h4>The study included 140 169 matched pairs of GLP-1RA and AOM initiators. Mean follow-up was 392 days for GLP-1RA users and 564 days for AOM users. Compared to AOMs, GLP-1RA use was associated with lower risks of MACE (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.81), MAKE (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.74), and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.42-0.57). Mental health outcomes also improved, with reduced risks of depression (HR, 0.63), suicidal ideation/attempt (HR, 0.42), and substance use disorder (HR, 0.58). GLP-1RAs were not associated with increased risks of acute pancreatitis (HR, 1.17), hypoglycemia (HR, 1.08), or gastrointestinal symptoms (HR, 0.99).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among adults with obesity but without diabetes, GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced cardiovascular, kidney, mortality, and mental health risks compared to other AOMs.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'g', '##lp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1ra']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
Metabolic regulation of obesity by naturally occurring compounds: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"The global obesity epidemic continues to escalate, driving demands for safer and more effective therapeutic strategies. This review evaluates the potential of natural bioactive compounds as multi-targeted interventions for obesity management. Plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), resveratrol), alkaloids (e.g., berberine), and marine carotenoids (e.g., fucoxanthin) demonstrate remarkable capacity to modulate fundamental obesity pathways through (A) suppression of adipogenesis via PPARγ and C/EBPα inhibition, (B) activation of lipolysis through hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) stimulation and AMPK phosphorylation, (C) enhancement of thermogenesis via UCP1 upregulation, and (D) gut microbiome modulation through SCFA production. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of selected compounds, with green tea catechins showing 4% to 5% body fat reduction and berberine demonstrating significant metabolic improvements. These natural agents offer distinct advantages over conventional drugs through their pleiotropic mechanisms and favorable safety profiles. However, bioavailability limitations and inter-individual variability present significant challenges. Innovative delivery systems, including nanoencapsulation and phospholipid complexes, show promise to enhance the therapeutic potential. The review highlights emerging strategies combining microbiome modulation with precision nutrition approaches while emphasizing the need for standardized clinical protocols. By bridging ethnopharmacological knowledge with modern scientific validation, natural compounds represent a promising avenue to develop sustainable, multi-targeted anti-obesity therapies that address both physiological and metabolic aspects of this complex disorder.",2025,"['pparγ', 'c / ebpα', 'lipase', 'hsl', 'ampk', 'ucp1', 'scfa']","['pparγ', 'lipase', 'hsl', 'ampk', 'ucp1', 'scfa']"
Gut-liver axis: An emerging target for exercise in obesity management.,"Gut dysbiosis emerged as a potential metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) trigger due to leaky gut and LPS leakage (endotoxemia). MASLD attracts attention from the scientific community due to the non-existence of a specific treatment, the intimate connection to obesity, and its multiple triggers. In this context, physical exercise is a relevant non-pharmacological strategy. However, different intensities and periodicities can produce divergent results, and their impact on the gut-liver axis remains unraveled. Therefore, this comprehensive review outlines the contribution of exercise (MICT or HIIT) to modulating the gut-liver axis in experimental obesity models, with a focus on the intestinal barrier and hepatic mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. The effects of both exercise protocols are likely related to restoring tight junctions and improving gut permeability. Ceased endotoxemia alleviates MASLD by targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, countering disturbances caused by glucolipotoxicity and inflammation, like ER stress and mitochondrial dyshomeostasis. Although HIIT is superior to MICT in enhancing gut structure and microbiota diversity and possibly mitigating MASLD due to reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity, regular exercise should be encouraged to counter the obesity pandemic by modulating the gut-liver axis.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Combined Hyaluronic Acid Nanobioconjugates Impair CD44-Signaling for Effective Treatment Against Obesity: A Review of Comparison with Other Actors.,"CD44, a key hyaluronic acid (HA) receptor, has emerged as a central mediator of adipose tissue inflammation, remodeling, and insulin resistance in obesity. Its overexpression in obese adipose depots promotes leukocyte infiltration, pro-inflammatory signaling, and extracellular matrix dysregulation processes that underlie metabolic dysfunction. This review explores the therapeutic relevance of targeting the HA-CD44 axis by synthesizing data primarily from preclinical studies, with emerging evidence from early clinical investigations. A narrative review methodology was employed to assess and compare therapeutic modalities, highlighting advances in molecular targeting, drug delivery systems, and metabolic interventions. We focus on two primary therapeutic classes: small molecules and nanobioconjugates. Small molecules, such as curcumin, metformin, and CD44 antagonists, offer systemic modulation and accessibility but are limited by their low tissue specificity and potential side effects. In contrast, HA-functionalized nanobioconjugates, including liposomes, PLGA nanoparticles, dendrimers, and exosomes, enable targeted delivery to adipose tissue, prolonged drug release, and reduced systemic toxicity. These nanosystems have demonstrated superior modulation of CD44 signaling, adipose inflammation, and glucose homeostasis in obesity models. Emerging strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, GLP-1 analogs, gene-editing tools (eg, CRISPR/Cas9), microbiome modulators, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) activators are also discussed. A comparative analysis indicates that nanobioconjugates offer the highest targeting precision, while small molecules remain advantageous in terms of cost and ease of administration. However, biologics and gene therapies face challenges related to delivery and scalability. Collectively, current evidence predominantly preclinical supports the HA-CD44 axis as a promising therapeutic target in obesity. Integrated approaches combining nanotechnology with molecular inhibitors and biologics could offer a multifaceted strategy for managing metabolic disease.",2025,"['cd44', 'h', '##yaluronic acid ( ha ) receptor', 'insulin', 'ha', 'cd44', 'cd44', 'cd44', 'glp - 1', 'ca', 'ha', 'cd44']","['cd44', 'insulin', 'glp 1']"
Guizhi fuling decoction inhibits pyroptosis to improve high-fat diet-induced obesity by up-regulating ACE2.,"Obesity has become a global public problem. Guizhi Fuling Decoction (GZFLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine decoction. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of GZFLD on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice. The obese mouse model was induced by HFD. The effects of GZFLD on obesity were assessed by recording body weight (BW) and inguinal white adipose tissue (Ing-WAT) weight of mice. Histological changes in adipose and liver tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was exploited to detect the expression of blood lipid indexes and inflammatory factors. The expression of pyroptosis-related proteins was detected by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Transcriptome sequencing was executed to explore the mechanism of GZFLD on obese mice and screen the pyroptosis-related genes. Furthermore, the effect of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on obese mice was verified by ACE2 inhibitor-DX600. In HFD-induced mice, with the increased dose of GZFLD, GZFLD significantly improved obesity, hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia, with decreased BW, Ing-WAT weight, Ing-WAT/BW ratio, levels of triglycerides, cholesterol low-density lipoprotein, and increased high-density lipoprotein levels. Hematoxylin-eosin staining exhibited that GZFLD improved steatosis and adipocyte enlargement induced by HFD. Additionally, GZFLD suppressed the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, inflammation factors, and pyroptosis-related proteins. RNA-sequencing identified ACE2 as a key gene target. The ACE2 inhibitor DX600 attenuated the inhibitory effects of GZFLD on hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and pyroptosis in HFD-induced obese mice. Collectively, GZFLD had a protective effect on HFD-induced obesity by alleviating dyslipidemia, and inhibiting inflammation and pyroptosis, which was achieved by up-regulating ACE2.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10616-025-00848-x.",2025,"['hem', '##atoxylin', 'eosin', 'g', '##fld', 'angiotensin - converting enzyme 2', 'ace2', 'ace2', 'g', '##fld', 'g', 'cholesterol low - density lipoprotein', 'high - density lipoprotein', 'hem', '##atoxylin -', 'eosin', '##f', 'g', '##fld', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'ace2', 'ace2', 'g', '##fld', 'gzfld']","['hem', 'eosin', 'angiotensin converting enzyme 2', 'ace2', 'high density lipoprotein', 'lactate dehydrogenase']"
Adipose tissue-targeted drug delivery for treating obesity: current opportunities and challenges.,"Obesity has emerged as a global public health crisis in the 21st century, with its prevalence continuing to rise worldwide. Beyond its well-established links to metabolic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease), obesity correlates significantly with oncological and musculoskeletal morbidity. Researchers have discovered that converting energy-storing white adipose tissue (WAT) into energy-expending thermogenic fat through external stimuli or browning agents-a process termed 'white fat browning'-has become a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity and its complications. This transformation is mediated by the activation of key factors such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which promotes thermogenesis and energy expenditure in adipocytes, thereby reducing fat accumulation. Studies have shown that certain pharmacological agents (e.g. β3-adrenergic receptor agonists) or natural compounds (e.g. resveratrol, capsaicin) can effectively induce white fat browning. However, systemic administration of these agents may cause off-target effects, such as cardiovascular overstimulation or metabolic disturbances, significantly limiting their clinical application. To address this challenge, adipose tissue-targeted drug delivery systems have been developed. These systems utilize either the unique microenvironment of adipose tissue (e.g. specific receptor expression) or nanocarrier technologies (e.g. polymeric nanoparticles) to precisely deliver browning agents to target fat depots. This review summarizes recent advances in targeted delivery vectors for obesity treatment via white fat browning, while also discussing challenges in nanomaterial design, targeting strategy optimization, and clinical translation.",2025,"['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'β3 - adrenergic receptor']","['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
Impact of Obesity on Serum Concentrations of Vancomycin Administered as Continuous Infusion and on Clinical Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients-A Retrospective Observational Study.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Vancomycin is a commonly used antibiotic in critically ill patients with severe methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections. Due to its narrow therapeutic window, under- or overdosing is likely to result in adverse effects, especially in patients with conditions associated with altered pharmacokinetics such as obesity. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of obesity on serum concentrations of vancomycin in critically ill patients receiving intravenous vancomycin by continuous infusion based on ideal body weight (IBW). <b>Methods</b>: This retrospective observational study performed at the University Hospital of Leipzig, Germany, included all patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2009 and December 2015 who received guideline-based vancomycin therapy based on IBW. Serum concentrations were obtained through routinely performed therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). <b>Results</b>: A total of 1066 patients with a median age of 62 years were included in this study. The median (25%; 75% quantile) vancomycin treatment duration was 4 (2; 7) days and the median time to reach target concentrations of 20-25 mg L<sup>-1</sup> was 3 (2; 4) days without a significant difference between BMI groups. Overall, only 25.9% of patients were in the therapeutic range of 20-25 mg L<sup>-1</sup> in the entire treatment interval. 47.8% of vancomycin concentrations obtained from TDM were below the desired target range with no differences between the BMI groups (<i>p</i> = 0.077). 26.3% of measurements exceeded the target range, with a significant increase in the morbidly obese group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). A higher BMI was associated with an increased ICU, in-hospital, 28- and 90-day mortality in morbidly obese patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Age, BMI and high SAPS-II and SOFA scores were significant predictors of an increased risk of death. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our preliminary findings suggest that IBW-based dosing may help reduce the risk of supratherapeutic concentrations in morbidly obese patients. The high rates of sub- and supratherapeutic vancomycin serum concentrations across all patients highlight the need for close TDM and dose adjustments, particularly in morbidly obese patients with the highest rates of supratherapeutic vancomycin serum concentrations and of RRT.",2025,[],[]
The role of glutamine metabolism and ASCT2/SLC1A5 transporter on insulin resistance and endoplasmic reticulum stress in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.,"Obesity is one of the major health issues of recent times. It is known that obesity increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, contributing to the development of insulin resistance in type-2 diabetes. This study investigates the relationship of glutamine metabolism with insulin resistance and ER stress under obese conditions. Using differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we demonstrate that increased glutamine supplementation enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces ER stress. Enhanced glutamine treatment also upregulated key amino acid transporters, Alanine-Serine-Cysteine Transporter 2 (ASCT2), L-type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1), and Cystine/Glutamate Antiporter (xCT), activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. To investigate the specific role of ASCT2, its expression was reduced in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts via sh-ASCT2 transfection prior to adipogenic differentiation. Interestingly, the levels of other selected glutamine-glutamate transporters, LAT1 and xCT, were also decreased. Knockdown of ASCT2 via shRNA significantly impaired adipocyte differentiation. The significant reduction of intracellular lipid accumulation leads to decreased ER stress and insulin resistance in sh-ASCT2 adipocytes. Metabolomic analysis results revealed that intracellular glutamine and malate levels increased during fat cell differentiation. The glutamine levels decreased in sh-ASCT2 adipocytes, while malate levels remained unchanged. In conclusion, glutamine may enhance insulin sensitivity by modulating ER stress and influencing transporter expression. ASCT2 might play a role in adipocyte differentiation, and evidence indicates that ASCT2 inhibition could be associated with reduced adipogenesis and improved insulin signaling, suggesting its potential relevance as a therapeutic target in obesity-related insulin resistance. Further studies are needed to clarify the context-dependent mechanisms by which glutamine and ASCT2 regulate metabolic stress adaptation.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'al', '##anine - serine - cysteine transporter 2', 'asct2', 'l - type amino acid transporter 1', 'lat1', 'cystine / glutamate antiporter', 'xct', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor', 'asct2', 'sh - asct2', 'glutamine - glutamate transporters', 'lat1', 'xct', 'asct2', 'shrna', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'asct2', 'asct2', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'asct2']","['insulin', 'asct2', 'lat1', 'xct', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor']"
Fatty acid transport protein 2: A novel therapeutic target in lipid metabolism and disease - A review.,"Fatty Acid Transport Protein 2 (FATP2) is a crucial integral protein that facilitates the transport and activation of long-chain fatty acids, which are vital for lipid metabolism and various cellular functions. FATP2 is found in multiple tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and placenta, where it plays a significant role in regulating fatty acid uptake, energy storage, and membrane synthesis. This review seeks to offer an in-depth understanding of the function of FATP2 in both health and disease contexts. The focus will be on its involvement in metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, the review will investigate FATP2's role in cancer, diabetes, renal diseases, osteoclastogenesis, preeclampsia, maternal obesity, and viral infections like HBV and EBV. By analyzing the mechanisms through which FATP2 influences lipid metabolism and the progression of diseases, this review underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. Gaining insights into the diverse functions of FATP2 is essential for developing strategies aimed at managing metabolic diseases, cancer, and obesity-related issues, ultimately leading to enhanced health outcomes.",2025,"['fatty acid transport protein 2', 'fatp2', 'fatp2', 'fatp2', 'insulin', 'fatp2', 'fatp2', 'fatp2']","['fatty acid transport protein 2', 'fatp2', 'insulin']"
Epicardial Adipose Tissue-A Novel Therapeutic Target in Obesity Cardiomyopathy.,"Obesity is strongly associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Recent studies indicate that epicardial adipose tissue plays a critical role in the development of obesity-related cardiomyopathy. This distinct visceral fat depot, located between the myocardium and the visceral pericardium, is involved in direct cross-talk with the adjacent myocardium, influencing both its structural integrity and electrophysiological function. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the morphological, metabolic, immunological, and functional alterations of this adipose compartment in the context of obesity, and to explore its contribution to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Moreover, the article synthesizes current evidence on the potential cardioprotective effects of emerging anti-obesity pharmacotherapies-particularly GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists-on metabolic pathways associated with epicardial fat that are implicated in obesity-induced cardiomyopathy. Further clinical trials are required to clarify the impact of these therapies on the course and prognosis of heart failure, as well as on the epidemiology and societal burden of the disease.",2025,"['g', '##lp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'gip receptor']","['glp 1', 'gip receptor']"
Engagement With and Impact of an mHealth App for Childhood Obesity Prevention and Management: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity is a serious global health concern that affects approximately 20% of children worldwide. Digital health behavior change interventions have the potential to improve behaviors that can contribute to childhood obesity, such as diet and physical activity, but often lack sufficient user engagement to achieve significant impact.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this project is to develop evidence to better understand how users engage with digital interventions and how behavior change techniques can be leveraged to support engagement. Specifically, the study will examine the impact of a family-focused app for childhood obesity prevention on health behaviors, health outcomes, and communication between families and health care professionals (HCPs).<h4>Methods</h4>A pretest-posttest, mixed methods evaluation will examine the impact of the NoObesity app on families' physical activity and dietary behaviors and on HCPs' self-efficacy at communicating with families about childhood obesity. Secondary outcomes will include well-being, usability, and users' engagement with and perceptions of the intervention. An initial sample of 1000 families (children and young people of any weight and age under 18 years and their parents) and 180 HCPs will be recruited to participate in the study; a subset of these participants will be invited to take part in qualitative semistructured interviews. The study implementation and follow-up period will last for 6 months, with the outcomes measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after baseline. Quantitative outcomes will be compared over time using repeated measures ANOVA, and qualitative data will be analyzed thematically and triangulated with app use data.<h4>Results</h4>Ethics approval was granted by the Newcastle University Faculty of Medical Science Ethics Committee (2688/41816) on March 22, 2024. Recruitment has not yet started but will involve capturing informed consent (and assent from participants younger than 16 years).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The project's key contributions will be to generate evidence of the potential for a family-based digital intervention to support families' health behavior change and HCPs' confidence in their ability to support them and to improve our understanding of how particular behavior change techniques can be used to support engagement with the intervention and its target behavior. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and shared with the general public, with support from patient and public involvement representatives.",2025,[],[]
MT1-MMP inhibition rejuvenates ageing brain and rescues cognitive deficits in obesity.,"Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in later life. Although aging and obesity are both associated with cognitive decline, it remains unclear how they interact to affect cognitive function across the lifespan and how brain function might mediate their relationship with cognition. Our previous findings and other studies have shown that membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP14), which increases with age, regulates energy homeostasis. Inhibiting MT1-MMP improves insulin sensitivity, reduces body fat, and lowers serum cholesterol. Here, we demonstrate that MT1-MMP links neuroinflammation to cognitive decline in aging and obesity. Inflammatory responses in the brain increase MT1-MMP activation in the hippocampus of both mice and humans. Activation of hippocampal MT1-MMP alone can trigger cognitive decline and synaptic impairment independently of neuroinflammation. Conversely, ablation of MT1-MMP in the hippocampus reverses cognitive decline and improves synaptic plasticity in aging and obesity. Pharmacological inhibition of MT1-MMP, through an orally administered brain-penetrant inhibitor or targeted delivery of a neutralizing antibody to the hippocampus, improves memory and learning in aged and obese mice without toxicity. Mechanistically, MT1-MMP proteolytically inactivates G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), a hippocampal receptor for osteocalcin (OCN) that is important for the maintenance of cognitive integrity, thus suppressing the ability of the OCN-GPR158 axis to promote cognition in aging and obesity. These findings suggest a new mechanism underlying hippocampal dysfunction and reveal the potential for treating multiple age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, with a single MT1-MMP-blocking agent.",2025,"['membrane type 1 - matrix metalloproteinase', 'mt1 - mmp', 'mmp14', 'mt1 - mmp', 'insulin', 'mt1 - mmp', 'mt1 - mmp', 'mt1 - mmp', 'mt1 - mmp', 'mt1 - mmp', 'mt1 - mmp', 'g - protein - coupled receptor 158', 'gpr158', 'hippocampal receptor', 'osteocalcin', 'ocn', 'ocn', 'gpr158', 'mt1 - mmp']","['membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase', 'mmp14', 'insulin', 'gpr158', 'osteocalcin', 'ocn']"
"A Review of Syndromic Forms of Obesity: Genetic Etiology, Clinical Features, and Molecular Diagnosis.","<h4>Background</h4>Syndromic forms of obesity are uncommon, complicated illnesses that include early-onset obesity along with other clinical characteristics such as organ-specific abnormalities, dysmorphic symptoms, and intellectual incapacity. These syndromes frequently have a strong genetic foundation, involving copy number variations, monogenic mutations, and chromosomal abnormalities.<h4>Methods</h4>Using terms like ""syndromic obesity,"" ""genetic diagnosis,"" and ""monogenic obesity,"" a comprehensive literature search was conducted to find articles published between 2000 and 2025 in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Peer-reviewed research addressing the clinical, molecular, or genetic aspects of syndromic obesity were among the inclusion criteria. Conference abstracts, non-English publications, and research without genetic validation were among the exclusion criteria. The whole genetic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic domains were thematically synthesized to create a thorough, fact-based story. Research using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), whole-exome sequencing (WES), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and new long-read sequencing platforms was highlighted.<h4>Results</h4>Despite the fact that molecular diagnostics, especially NGS and CMA, have made tremendous progress in identifying pathogenic variants, between 30 and 40 percent of instances of syndromic obesity are still genetically unexplained. One significant issue is the variation in phenotype across people with the same mutation, which suggests the impact of environmental modifiers and epigenetic variables. In addition, differences in access to genetic testing, particularly in areas with limited resources, can make it difficult to diagnose patients in a timely manner. Additionally, recent research emphasizes the possible contribution of gene-environment interactions, gut microbiota, and multi-omic integration to modifying disease expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Syndromic obesity is still poorly understood in a variety of groups despite significant advancements in technology. Multi-layered genomic investigations, functional genomic integration, and standardized diagnostic frameworks are necessary to close existing gaps. The development of tailored treatment plans, such as gene editing and focused pharmaceutical therapies as well as fair access to cutting-edge diagnostics are essential to improving outcomes for people with syndromic obesity.",2025,[],[]
GPRC5B preserves a mature β-cell state in obesity by controlling MafA expression.,"In vitro studies have implicated orphan receptor GPRC5B in β-cell survival, proliferation and insulin secretion, but its relevance for glucose homeostasis in vivo is largely unknown. Using tamoxifen-inducible, β-cell-specific GPRC5B knockout mice (Ins-G5b-KOs) we show here that loss of GPRC5B does not affect β-cell function in the lean state, but results in strongly reduced insulin secretion and disturbed glucose tolerance in mice subjected to high fat diet for 16 weeks. Flow cytometry and single-cell expression analyses in islets from obese mice show a reduced β-cell abundance and a less mature β-cell phenotype in Ins-G5b-KOs. Expression of β-cell-specific transcription factor MafA is reduced both on the RNA and protein level, as are transcripts of MafA target genes. Mechanistically, we show that phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a major regulator of MafA expression, is reduced in islets of obese Ins-G5b-KOs, and that this phenotype precedes the downregulation of MafA and MafA target genes. Taken together, GPRC5B helps to maintain mature β-cell function in obesity through cAMP/CREB-dependent regulation of MafA expression.",2025,"['orphan receptor gprc5b', 'insulin', 'gprc5b', 'gprc5b', 'insulin', 'β - cell - specific transcription factor mafa', 'mafa target genes', 'camp response element - binding protein', 'creb', 'mafa', 'mafa', 'mafa target genes', 'gprc5b', 'creb', 'mafa']","['insulin', 'gprc5b', 'camp response element binding protein', 'creb', 'mafa']"
Targeting the Epigenetic Remodeler GCN5 Prevents Vascular Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Dysfunction in Obesity: Insights in Patients with Cardiometabolic Disease.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Epigenetic changes are important modulators of gene expression. The histone acetyltransferase gene non-derepressible 5 (Gcn5) is emerging as a pivotal epigenetic player in metabolism and cancer, yet its role in obesity and cardiovascular disease remains elusive.<h4>Aims</h4>To investigate Gcn5 role in obesity-related endothelial dysfunction.<h4>Methods</h4>Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were exposed to vehicle or palmitic acid (200 uM) in the presence or in the absence of the Gcn5 pharmacological inhibitor CPTH2 or gene silencing. Ex-vivo inhibition of Gcn5 was performed in aortic rings from diet-induced obese and control mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to investigate the epigenetic regulation of Nox2 promoter. In parallel, Gcn5/Nox2 expression was assessed by real-time PCR in vascular specimens isolated from obese patients and age-matched healthy controls. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was also assessed in human vessels.<h4>Results</h4>PA increased Gcn5 gene expression in HAECs. Gcn5 upregulation was associated with increased expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme Nox2. Interestingly, either Gcn5 inhibition or gene silencing prevented PA-induced Nox2 upregulation and oxidative stress accumulation. ChiP assay showed increased Gcn5 occupancy and enhanced histone 3 acetylation of lysine 14 (H3K14ac) on Nox2 promoter. In aortic rings from obese mice, pharmacological inhibition of Gcn5 by CPTH2 rescued endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation as compared to vehicle. Finally, Gcn5 was increased in vessels from obese patients and correlated with Nox2 expression and endothelial dysfunction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings shed light on the importance of epigenetic regulation in obesity and pinpoint Gcn5 as a therapeutic target to prevent endothelial dysfunction in cardiometabolic disease.",2025,"['histone acetyltransferase gene non - der', '##ressible 5', 'gcn5', 'gcn5', 'gcn5', 'cpth2', 'gcn5', 'nox2 promoter', 'gcn5', 'nox2', 'gcn5 gene', 'gcn5', 'nox2', 'gcn5', 'nox2', 'gcn5', 'histone 3', 'h3k14', 'nox2 promoter', 'gcn5', 'cpth2', 'gcn5', 'nox2', 'gcn5']","['gcn5', 'cpth2', 'nox2']"
Brain histaminergic system: An emerging target for the treatment of feeding and eating-related disorders.,"Feeding is an intrinsic and fundamental behavior regulated by complex neurobiological networks that integrate peripheral metabolic signals with neurotransmitter systems within key brain regions. Histamine, a biogenic amine acting as a neuromodulator in the central nervous system, plays a crucial role in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. Within the hypothalamus, histaminergic neurons influence appetite-related circuits, primarily through H<sub>1</sub>R and H<sub>3</sub>R. Central administration of histamine suppresses food consumption, an effect largely mediated via H<sub>1</sub>R. The blockade of H<sub>1</sub>R has been associated with increased appetite and weight gain, as observed with certain antihistaminic and antipsychotic drugs. Conversely, H<sub>3</sub>R antagonists, which enhance histaminergic tone by preventing autoinhibition, exhibit anorexigenic properties. Histamine also modulates peripheral mechanisms such as gluconeogenesis and ketone body production. Clinically, pharmacological modulation of histaminergic receptors has gained interest as a potential therapeutic approach for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders. Promising results are emerging from clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of betahistine, a drug with a dual pharmacological profile as a weak H<sub>1</sub>R agonist and potent H<sub>3</sub>R antagonist, in restoring histaminergic tone and counteracting weight gain and metabolic side effects induced by antipsychotic therapies. Reduced H<sub>1</sub>R binding in certain brain areas has been observed in patients with anorexia nervosa. In this review, we surveyed the role of brain histamine in the control of eating behavior and energy expenditure. We also described the implications of histamine release in the gut-brain axis and discussed available clinical data regarding the efficacy of histaminergic compounds in eating-related disorders.",2025,['histaminergic receptors'],[]
Role of miR-144-5p in modulating lipid metabolism and potentially alleviating obesity via the PGC-1α/AMPK pathway.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>MiR-144-5p is differentially expressed in plasma exosomes from Bactrian camels of varying body sizes, with GO and KEGG analyses indicating that its target genes play crucial roles in lipid metabolism. PGC-1α, confirmed as a key target through RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays, is a significant regulator of this process. This study aims to investigate the impact of miR-144-5p on lipid metabolism in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity to elucidate the mechanistic pathways involved.<h4>Methods</h4>Male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to groups and fed either a control diet or an HFD for 12 weeks, which was followed by a 3-week intervention with miR-144-5p. Various metabolic parameters and gene expressions were evaluated to determine the effects of this treatment.<h4>Results</h4>The treatment significantly reduced diet-induced adiposity and decreased inflammatory responses. Additionally, it inhibited PGC-1α expression in the liver tissue of HFD-fed mice. There was an increase in CPT1 activity and fatty acid β-oxidation rate, along with the downregulation of FASN mRNA expression and the upregulation of CPT1 and ACOX1 expression, promoting fatty acid oxidation.<h4>Discussion</h4>These findings suggest that miR-144-5p exerts anti-obesity effects by enhancing fatty acid oxidation, likely through modulation of the PGC-1α/AMPK signaling pathway.

Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 as a Potential Biomarker for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children with Obesity: Preliminary Assessment of Metabolic Associations and Underlying Mechanisms.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the effects of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) on insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, as well as potential mechanisms contributing to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children with obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 107 children with obesity, aged between 5 and 15 years, including 55 with NAFLD and 52 without NAFLD. Anthropometric assessments and fasting blood samples were collected to evaluate GLP-2, plasma glucose, insulin (INS), lipids, leptin (LEP), and adiponectin (ADPN). Correlation and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between GLP-2 and metabolic parameters.<h4>Results</h4>Children with NAFLD exhibited significantly higher levels of GLP-2, LEP, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FPG), INS, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (all <i>p</i><0.05), along with significantly lower levels of ADPN and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with those without NAFLD (<i>p</i><0.05). GLP-2 concentrations correlated positively with TC (<i>r</i>=0.42), TG (<i>r</i>=0.51), LDL-C (<i>r</i>=0.38), FPG (<i>r</i>=0.61), INS (<i>r</i>=0.58), HOMA-IR (<i>r</i>=0.61), and LEP (<i>r</i>=0.42), and negatively with ADPN (<i>r</i>=-0.53; all <i>p</i><0.01). In univariate analysis, GLP-2 was identified as a risk factor for NAFLD (odds ratio [OR]=1.225, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.499, <i>p</i><0.05); however, the association was attenuated after adjustment for body mass index (OR=1.112, <i>p</i>=0.102). ADPN retained a protective association (OR=0.771, <i>p</i><0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>GLP-2 may contribute to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in pediatric NAFLD, potentially via modulation of adipokine activity.

SERUM LncRNA SNHG16: A Biomarker for Diagnosing Childhood Obesity and Predicting Its Progression to Metabolic Syndrome.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MS) in children. This study explores the expression and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA SNHG16 (SNHG16) in childhood obesity and its complications with MS (obesity-MS).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Healthy controls and obese children (categorized as those with simple obesity or obesity-MS) were enrolled. Serum SNHG16 and miR-27a-3p levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. ROC curves evaluated SNHG16's diagnostic value for obesity. Logistic regression analysis identified potential risk factors for the development of obesity-MS. DLR assay and RIP assay confirmed the interaction between SNHG16 and miR-27a-3p. Bioinformatics was used to predict downstream genes of miR-27a-3p and, then GO and KEGG enrichment analysis identified the functions and signaling pathways of these genes.<h4>Results</h4>Serum SNHG16 levels were distinctly upregulated in obese children, especially those with obesity-MS. In contrast, miR-27a-3p expression showed the opposite trend. Additionally, SNHG16 was positively correlated with BMI in obese children. Serum SNHG16 exhibited 81.18% sensitivity and 76.47% specificity in distinguishing controls from obese individuals. Furthermore, serum SNHG16, BMI, HOMA-IR, and TG are potential risk factors for MS in obese children. Mechanistically, SNHG16 directly targets miR-27a-3p, and miR-27a-3p targets 65 genes primarily enriched in insulin response and the MAPK, Ras, and mTOR signaling pathways.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Elevated serum SNHG16 levels may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for obese children and predict obesity-MS.

Adipose tissue NLRP3 inflammasome: a therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Adipose tissue has been identified as a crucial player in the release of proinflammatory mediators, which can result in a chronic inflammatory state, predisposing individuals to obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A major approach in tackling these diseases involves targeting molecular sensors that can respond to nutritional cues and metabolic status that trigger the early phases of inflammatory cascades. Among these sensors is the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-, leucine-rich repeat-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.

GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Substance Use Disorders in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Target Trial Emulation.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), approved for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, may modulate reward pathways and reduce substance-related behaviors. This study assessed the association between GLP-1RA use and substance use-related hospitalization in older adults with coexisting T2D and substance use disorders (SUD).<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective cohort study using 2016-2020 Medicare data compared GLP-1RA initiators with new users of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) or DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) among adults aged ≥ 65. The primary outcome was hospitalization for any SUD; secondary outcomes included hospitalizations for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD). Propensity score 1:1 matching and Cox proportional hazards models were used under an intention-to-treat approach.<h4>Results</h4>In the GLP-1RA versus DPP4i cohort (n = 4920), GLP-1RA users had a lower risk of SUD hospitalization (HR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86) and OUD hospitalization (HR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.96), with a nonsignificant trend for AUD (HR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.53-1.08). No significant differences were observed compared to SGLT2is (n = 4620).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among older adults with T2D, GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced SUD-related hospitalization versus DPP4i use, suggesting potential repurposing for SUD management.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'glp - 1ra', 's', '##glt2', 's', '##glt2is', 'dpp - 4', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', '##i', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', '##lt2', 'g', '##lp - 1ra']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
Integrated miRNA-mRNA Analyses of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in Black and White Patients with or Without Obesity.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive, heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer. miRNAs play an essential role in TNBC pathogenesis and prognosis. Obesity is linked with an increased risk for several cancers, including breast cancer. Obesity is also related to the dysregulation of miRNA expression in adipose tissues. However, there is limited knowledge about race- and obesity-specific differential miRNA expression in TNBC. We performed miRNA sequencing of 48 samples (24 tumor and 24 adjacent non-tumor tissues) and RNA sequencing of 24 tumors samples from Black (AA) and White (EA) TNBC patients with or without obesity. We identified 55 miRNAs exclusively associated with tumors in obese EA patients and 33 miRNAs in obese AA patients, each capable of distinguishing tumor tissues from obese from lean individuals within their respective racial groups. In EA, we detected 41 significant miRNA-mRNA correlations. Notably, miR-181b-5p and miR-877-5p acted as negative regulators of tumor-suppressor genes (e.g., <i>HEY2</i>, <i>MCL2</i>, <i>HAND2</i>), while miR-204-5p and miR-143-3p appeared to indirectly target oncogenes (e.g., <i>RAB10</i>, <i>DR1</i>, <i>PTBP3</i>, <i>NCBP1</i>). Among AA patients, we found 28 significant miRNA-mRNA interactions. miR-195-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-130a-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-374-5p, and miR-30a-5p each potentially downregulated two or more genes (e.g., <i>CLCN4</i>, <i>PLCB1</i>, <i>CDC25B</i>, <i>AEBP2</i>, <i>ERBB4</i>). Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted <i>KRAS</i>, <i>ESR1</i>, <i>ESR2</i>, <i>RAB10</i>, <i>TNRC6C</i>, and <i>NCAN</i> as the most commonly differentially expressed in EA, whereas <i>ERBB4</i>, <i>PLCB1</i>, and <i>SERPINE1</i> were most frequently in AA. These findings highlight the importance of considering race-specific miRNA-mRNA signatures in understanding TNBC in the context of obesity, offering insights into biomarker-driven patient stratification for targeted therapeutic strategies.",2025,"['mir - 181b - 5p', 'mir - 877 - 5p', 'm', '##l2', 'mir - 204 - 5p', 'mir - 143 - 3p', 'rab10', 'dr1', 'ptbp3', 'ncbp1', 'mir - 195 - 5p', 'mir - 130a - 3p', 'mir - 130a - 5p', 'mir - 424 - 5p', 'mir - 148a - 3p', 'mir - 374 - 5p', 'mir - 30a - 5p', 'clcn4', 'plcb1', 'cdc25b', 'aebp', 'erbb4', 'k', '##1', 'rab10', 'tnrc6c', 'erbb4', 'plcb1', 'serpine1']","['rab10', 'dr1', 'ptbp3', 'ncbp1', 'clcn4', 'plcb1', 'cdc25b', 'erbb4', 'tnrc6c', 'serpine1']"
"Obesity as a Chronic Disease: A Narrative Review of Evolving Definitions, Management Strategies, and Cardiometabolic Prioritization.","Obesity is a multifactorial, complex disease that is driven by genetic, biological, environmental, and behavioral factors. In this review, we explain the key contributors to obesity, limitations in current definitions, its relationship with cardiometabolic health, and recent advancements in treatment. Obesity is characterized by the presence of excess and dysfunctional adipose tissue, driven by chronic inflammation and maladaptive energy homeostasis. Although body mass index (BMI) has historically been used to diagnose obesity, BMI provides a limited evaluation of individual patients because it fails to specifically quantify adiposity, which is the primary determinant of metabolic impact in these patients. There is an ongoing and necessary shift in treating obesity with a weight-inclusive approach that aims to address obesity upstream and prevent downstream cardiometabolic health complications. This approach is being supported by various treatment options, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide, that also have promising effects on cardiovascular, renal, and liver health. Advances in precision medicine, gut microbiome research, and Multi-target therapies support personalized therapeutic approach. Despite these developments, less than 25% of individuals living with obesity are receiving evidence-based treatment. There is an urgent need to improve health care delivery to patients with obesity through timely, affordable, and multimodal treatments that promote sustainable and sustained weight loss. Increasing board certification of practicing physicians through the American Board of Obesity Medicine will be critical to improving access and quality of care.",2025,['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor'],['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
"Orexin and Lifestyle Habits: A Meaningful Connection Among Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Sleep Pattern in Health and Diseases.","Orexin is a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus that plays a key role in regulating slee-wake cycles, energy metabolism, feeding behavior, and physical activity. It exists in two forms, orexin-A and orexin-B, which bind to G protein-coupled receptors OX<sub>1</sub>R and OX<sub>2</sub>R with differing affinities. Orexin signaling is widespread in the brain and extends to peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue. Its involvement in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic circuits suggests a broad role in homeostatic regulation. Dysfunctions in the orexinergic system are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis, particularly through mechanisms involving sleep disturbances and neuroinflammation. This study examines how orexin influences neural circuits related to arousal, motivation, and motor control. It also explores how physical activity stimulates orexin release, enhancing neuroplasticity and cognitive resilience. In addition, orexin's role in reward-related feeding, genetic susceptibility to obesity, and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis is discussed. Overall, the orexinergic system represents a vital neurochemical link between physical activity, metabolism, and cognitive health. Although many of its mechanisms remain to be clarified, its central role in integrating energy balance and behavioral responses makes it a promising target for future therapeutic strategies.",2025,"['orexin', 'orexin - a', 'orexin - b', 'g protein - coupled receptors', 'orexin', 'orexin', 'orexin', 'orexin']","['orexin', 'orexin a', 'orexin b', 'g protein coupled receptors']"
Combined Naltrexone-Bupropion Therapy for Concurrent Cocaine Use Disorder and Obesity: A Case Report.,"<b>Background and Clinical Significance:</b> Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is characterized by recurrent, cue-triggered and intrusive urges to use cocaine (craving), compulsive drug-seeking despite adverse consequences, and impaired control over intake, often co-occurring with excess weight and hedonic overeating. A dual-target rationale supports the fixed-dose naltrexone-bupropion (NB) combination: μ-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonism may mitigate opioid-facilitated mesolimbic reinforcement, while bupropion's catecholaminergic effects and POMC activation support satiety and weight loss. <b>Case Presentation:</b> We describe a case study from an Italian outpatient setting of a 35-year-old man with a 10-year history of CUD, multiple failed detoxifications, and class I obesity (body mass index [BMI] 31 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who initiated fixed-dose NB and was followed for 12 weeks under routine care. NB was associated with progressive attenuation of cue-reactive cocaine craving and improved appetite control, alongside clinically meaningful weight reduction, without psychiatric destabilization or emergent safety concerns; medication adherence remained stable. The patient maintained abstinence throughout follow-up and reported improved psychosocial functioning. Quantitatively, CCQ-B scores decreased from 7.2 at baseline to 2.1 at Week 12 (≈70% reduction), while BMI decreased from 31.0 to 25.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (≈-17.7%), with clinically meaningful weight loss and stable adherence. <b>Conclusions:</b> This case study supports the mechanistic rationale that dual NB therapy can simultaneously attenuate cocaine craving and facilitate weight control, addressing two clinically relevant targets in CUD. Although evidence for NB in CUD remains limited and mixed across stimulant populations, this observation highlights a plausible, testable therapeutic hypothesis that integrates mesolimbic and hypothalamic pathways and may inform the design of controlled trials in patients with co-occurring CUD and obesity.",2025,"['μ - opioid receptor', 'mor']",['mor']
Adipose-specific HuR deletion protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice through upregulating Ucp1 expression.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been proved to play essential roles in post-transcriptional regulation of genes associated with adipogenesis. However, the role of the RBP human antigen R (HuR) in the pathogenesis of obesity remains to be clarified.<h4>Methods</h4>Adipocyte-specific HuR knockout (HuR<sup>-/-</sup>) and HuR floxed (HuR<sup>f/f</sup>) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), or a paired normal control diet (NC) for 16 weeks. Moreover, 8-week-old HuR<sup>-/-</sup> or HuR<sup>f/f</sup> mice were subjected to cold exposure or CL316,243 treatments. The mouse body weight was recorded and the histological changes in adipose tissue were examined. RNA sequencing analysis and RT-qPCR were used to identify potential target genes for HuR. The regulation of HuR on the uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) expression was determined using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down, and Luciferase assays.<h4>Results</h4>Adipocyte-specific HuR deletion inhibited body weight gain with HFD feeding, being accompanied by less BAT whitening and more WAT browning, and up-regulated expressions of adipose thermogenic genes (Pgc-1α, Ucp1, etc.). HuR could bind to the 3'UTR of the Ucp1 mRNA, and thus downregulated its expression. In addition, although the HuR expression was not changed in obesity, there was an enhanced transfer of HuR protein from the nuclear to cytoplasm, thus impacting the expression of target genes including the Ucp1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings indicate that adipose tissue-specific HuR deletion alleviates HFD-induced obesity by promoting adipose thermogenesis through upregulating Ucp1 expression.",2025,"['rbps', 'rbp human antigen r', 'hur', 'h', 'hur', 'hur', 'hur', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'hur', 'hur', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'luciferase', 'hur', 'pgc - 1α', 'ucp1', 'hur', 'ucp1 mrna', 'hur', 'hur protein', 'ucp1', 'hur', 'ucp1']","['rbp', 'hur', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'luciferase', 'hur protein']"
INTERLEUKIN-18 AS A THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR WESTERN DIET-INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY,"<h4>Background</h4>  A diet high in saturated fats and sugars (Western diet-WD) promotes obesity and left ventricular dysfunction in the mouse, which is, at least in part, mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-18 (IL-18). Therefore, we hypothesized that a blocking recombinant-murine IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) would rescue cardiac function in WD-fed mice. <h4>Methods</h4>  In this 9-week study, 10-week-old adult C57BL/6J mice were assigned to standard diet (SD) or a WD. After 7 weeks of WD feeding, the mice were assigned to two groups: WD+IL-18BP (0.5 mg/kg daily, intraperitoneal injections) or WD control for the last 2 weeks of the study. Food intake, body weight, and glucose tolerance were assessed. Cardiac systolic and diastolic function were measured by Doppler echocardiography at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. IL-18 plasma levels were quantified with ELISA. <h4>Results</h4>  WD induced a significant increase in body weight, significantly worsened glucose tolerance, and significantly increased (worsening) in diastolic function (isovolumetric relaxation time -IRT- and myocardial performance index -MPI-) compared to SD. Rescue with IL-18BP in WD-fed mice resulted in a significant improvement in IRT and MPI, without significant changes in food intake, weight gain, or glucose tolerance. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  IL-18BP rescued cardiac function in mice with WD-induced diastolic dysfunction, independent of weight gain and glucose tolerance. These results confirm the central and independent role of IL-18 in cardiac dysfunction associated with diet-induced obesity.",2025,"['##yt', 'interleukin - 18', 'il - 18', 're', '##combinant - murine il - 18 binding protein', 'il - 18bp', 'il - 18bp', 'il - 18', 'il - 18bp', 'il - 18bp', 'il - 18']",['interleukin 18']
Alarming Rise of Obesity: The 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; United Nations High-Level Meeting on Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health Should Advance Action to Tackle Obesity.,"Obesity is a growing global crisis increasing the risk and outcomes of a range of noncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, steatotic liver disease, and kidney disease.Obesity in children tracks into adulthood increasing their risk of noncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases.A growing body of evidence confirms that there are affordable and scalable policies to promote a healthy diet and regular physical activity to prevent overweight and obesity including in children and adolescents.Despite the burden caused by obesity and its preventability, the topic does not appear to be a priority on the agenda of the global public health community and implementation of public health policies to prevent obesity at country level has been patchy.At the upcoming United Nations 4<sup>th</sup> High Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases, Heads of State and Government need to go beyond making political commitments to prevent obesity and, take concrete steps to increase and monitor budget allocations for implementing policies for population wide prevention of physical inactivity and unhealthy diet.Obesity is a chronic disease that affects over one billion people in the world and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. It is impossible to advance prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, without simultaneously halting the rise of obesity. The 2018 political declaration of the 3<sup>rd</sup> United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases calls for the Implementation of cost-effective and evidence-based interventions to halt the rise of overweight and obesity, especially childhood obesity. Since then, the evidence supporting the impact of regular physical activity and a healthy diet on the prevention of obesity has become more compelling. However, the prevalence of obesity across all age groups has increased due to the ineffective public policy response, the fierce opposition from commercial actors, and difficulties in navigating implementation challenges. This paper outlines the growing evidence, recent developments, and lessons learnt since 2018 and highlights new opportunities and remaining challenges with regard to prevention of obesity, ahead of the 4th United Nations High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases in September 2025.",2025,[],[]
The Mediator Complex: A Regulatory Hub for Transcriptional Activity of Nuclear Receptors.,"The Mediator complex plays a key role in gene transcription. In particular, the interaction of the Mediator complex with nuclear receptors, the known transcription factors, regulates multiple nuclear receptor-mediated gene transcription pathways and associated cellular functions. Dysregulation of the interaction of the Mediator complex with nuclear receptors results in many pathological processes, such as cancer, metabolic and neuronal diseases. Thus, understanding of the mechanism by which the Mediator complex regulates the nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activity and biological function is crucial for therapy of both the Mediator complex- and nuclear receptor-associated diseases. In this review article, we attempt to summarize current research progress in the interaction of the Mediator complex with nuclear receptors and the associated nuclear receptor transcriptional signaling pathways, explore the clinical potential of the Mediator complex as a therapeutic target, and provide new perspectives for the treatment of diseases associated with the Mediator complex and nuclear receptors.",2025,[],[]
A Review of Amylin Peptide Receptor Activators for Obesity Pharmacotherapy.,"Amylin is a thirty-seven amino acid peptide hormone that is secreted from the pancreas with insulin. The peptide hormone amylin activates its receptors in the brain to regulate blood glucose and food appetite. Interestingly, the amylin receptor is the heterodimer of the calcitonin receptor (which is the receptor for the peptide hormone calcitonin) and an accessory protein called receptor activity-modifying protein. Amylin receptor activation has emerged as a promising drug target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. Recent pharmaceutical efforts with amylin receptor activators have focused on developing drugs for the treatment of obesity. Multiple amylin analogs have been tested in pre-clinical settings, and some are currently being tested in clinical trials. In this review, recent research publications and available information regarding drug development targeting amylin receptors were searched. It summarizes the amylin receptor activators currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity. In addition, recent research achievements were demonstrated, such as the introduction of mutations that enhanced receptor affinity/potency and the development of a method for measuring selective amylin receptor activation. Potential issues along with peptide drug development were described, including lipidation to achieve a long-acting property. The combination of an amylin analog and other anti-obesity peptide drugs has demonstrated higher clinical efficacy in reducing body weight than monotherapy. The combination therapy is likely to be the first drug therapy where an amylin analog is used for obesity treatment. In addition, amylin receptor activators may have an adverse effect profile more favorable than that of GLP-1 receptor activators, which could be a potential benefit of amylin receptor activators.",2025,"['amylin', 'insulin', 'amylin', 'amylin receptor', 'calcitonin receptor', '##eptide hormone', 'calcitonin', 'receptor activity - modifying protein', 'amylin receptor', 'amylin receptor', 'amylin', 'amylin receptors', 'amylin receptor', 'amylin receptor', 'amylin', 'amylin', 'amylin receptor', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'amylin receptor']","['amylin', 'insulin', 'amylin receptor', 'calcitonin receptor', 'calcitonin', 'receptor activity modifying protein', 'amylin receptors', 'glp 1 receptor']"
Prevalence of Overweight/Obesity Among Under-Five Children in Lower Middle-Income Countries and Assessment of the Reported Associated Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Overweight/obesity among children under five is a growing global concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet consolidated evidence of this burden remains limited, which is crucial to target interventions. This review synthesises data from community-based studies to estimate the overall and individual pooled prevalences of overweight/obesity in this population and explores the factors associated.<h4>Methodology</h4>PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE were searched and screened for eligible studies published between April 2014 and 2024 individually by two researchers. Quality assessment of the eligible studies was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Data regarding the prevalence of overweight, obesity and their associated factors, including maternal education, area of residence, maternal body weight, household incomes and breastfeeding practices, as reported in these included studies, were extracted. A random-effect model was used for the meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was evaluated using I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analyses comparing effect sizes across categories of geographic regions, overweight/obesity measurement guidelines, sample sizes and publication years. Meta-regression assessed the relationship between these variables and the pooled estimates.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 13 734 studies screened, 21 were eligible for inclusion. The pooled prevalence of overweight/obesity among the under-five children in LMICs was 8.57% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.24-12.63, I<sup>2</sup> 100% at p value < 0.01) with significant heterogeneity. Overnutrition prevalence increased from 7.43% during the 5 years of 2014-2018 to 9.12% during 2019-2023. The pooled prevalence of overweight/obesity varied significantly across geography, with the highest prevalence in the African region (17%) and the lowest in the Southeast Asian region (3.41%). Across the four studies that reported maternal education, children of mothers with secondary school education or higher had increased odds of having overweight/obesity [Odds Ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.51 (1.21-1.88)]. Prevalence estimates also differed significantly by gender, with 6.89% for under-five boys and 4.75% for girls [OR (95% CI): 1.48 (1.08-2.04)]. Although individual studies reported significant associations with other factors such as area of residence, maternal body weight, income status and breastfeeding practices, a meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Trends in childhood overnutrition in LMICs are concerning, with overall prevalence approaching estimates of those reported in a few high-income nations. Geographic variability, gender disparity and association with maternal education emphasise the need for region-specific policies, focusing on community engagement and awareness towards rising overnutrition.",2025,[],[]
Emotional Eating and Obesity: An Update and New Insights.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The current review aimed to (1) synthesize information regarding the association between emotional eating (EE) and BMI, as well as between EE and dietary intake and psychological symptoms; (2) describe factors thought to underlie and/or maintain EE; and (3) summarize recent evidence supporting behavioral treatments of EE in people with obesity.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Adults with obesity frequently report EE. Emotion regulation and learning principles are key variables that may influence EE in adults with obesity. Behavioral treatments show promise for decreasing EE, in the short-term, especially cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based approaches. Although psychosocial factors are critical to the understanding of EE mechanisms and treatment, limitations include measurement of EE and construct definitions of proposed theoretical variables. Additionally, behavioral interventions overlap which obscures the relative utility of treatment components. Future work should clarify causal mechanisms of EE in the context of obesity to inform treatment development.",2025,[],[]
A role of extracellular vesicle-mediated inter-organ communication in obesity-related arrhythmia,"<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  Obesity contributes to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show visceral adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (VAT EVs) from individuals with obesity prolong action potential duration (APD) and impair calcium handling in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, in addition to activating fibroblasts and macrophages towards a pro-fibrotic/inflammatory state, thereby creating pro-arrhythmic substrate. Adipose-derived EVs target the heart in obese mice, suggesting the potential for direct communication. Transcriptome-wide genetic association (TWAS) and epigenetic studies anchored on genes differentially expressed in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages after VAT-EV exposure identified genes significantly associated with QT interval and atrial fibrillation. Finally, as a proof-of-principle, we pharmacologically blocked TRPC3 (a VAT-EV-induced ion channel) in cardiomyocytes, restoring the APD towards normality. This molecular genetic evidence supports an EV-mediated direct communication pathway between adipose tissue and the heart in arrhythmogenesis, offering a new paradigm to identify mediators of cardiovascular disease in obesity. <h4>Graphical Abstract</h4>",2025,['trpc3'],['trpc3']
Nanosphere loaded with curcumin attenuates adipogenesis and lipid metabolism by modulating AKT/mTORC1/PPARγ phosphorylation.,"Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol derived from turmeric, exhibits diverse biological activities as a natural supplement. However, its low gastrointestinal absorption significantly limits its oral bioavailability. In this study, we investigated the effects of curcumin-loaded nanospheres (CN) on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells and obesity development in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. CN markedly suppressed adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, demonstrating approximately 100-fold greater anti-adipogenic activity compared to native curcumin. Mechanistically, CN inhibited mTOR phosphorylation by modulating intracellular reactive oxygen species during adipocyte differentiation. Notably, CN restored fatty acid synthase expression through regulation of PPARγ phosphorylation. In high-fat diet-fed mice, oral administration of CN significantly reduced body weight without altering food intake. Furthermore, CN alleviated the accumulation of white adipose tissue and liver mass, along with a reduction in plasma total cholesterol levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that CN enhances the bioavailability of curcumin and exerts potent anti-obesity effects by targeting adipogenesis and lipid metabolism.",2025,"['mtor', 'fatty acid synthase', 'pparγ']","['mtor', 'fatty acid synthase', 'pparγ']"
Topiramate Enhances GABAergic Tone to Orexigenic Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-Related Peptide (NPY/AgRP) Neurons.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Topiramate is a medication used off-label, or in combination with phentermine, for the management of obesity. However, its mechanism of action remains elusive. As many obesity medications target the brain, we aimed to determine if topiramate influences the activity of hypothalamic melanocortin neurons known to regulate energy balance.<h4>Methods</h4>Transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent protein in either ""orexigenic"" neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) or ""anorexigenic"" pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons were used to perform whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology experiments in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus.<h4>Results</h4>Topiramate (1 μM) strongly inhibited NPY/AgRP neuron electrical excitability. Despite topiramate's well-known actions at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, we demonstrate that the topiramate-induced inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons does not involve GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The effects of topiramate on NPY/AgRP neurons were suppressed by inhibitors of synaptic transmission and after blockade of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors or potassium channels. In contrast, topiramate had negligible influence on the activity of POMC neurons.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study is the first demonstration that topiramate strongly inhibits the activity of ARC NPY/AgRP neurons and suggests that enhanced GABAergic tone to these neurons mediates this effect. The ability of topiramate to inhibit the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons may underlie some of its weight-lowering properties.",2025,"['neuropeptide y', 'agouti - related peptide', 'npy', 'agrp', 'pro - opiomelanocortin', 'pomc', 'npy', 'ag', 'npy', 'agrp', 'n', 'ag', 'npy', 'ag', 'npy', 'agrp']","['neuropeptide y', 'npy', 'agrp', 'pro opiomelanocortin', 'pomc']"

Prevalence and clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in a population aged 25-64 in Czechia: A cross-sectional study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Cardiovascular events are still the most common cause of death in the Czech Republic. The increasing prevalence of risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes individually and collectively contribute to cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to determine their prevalence and interrelationships.<h4>Method</h4>The data for this epidemiological study were obtained from the Czech cross-sectional study EHES 2019 (European Health Examination Survey) with stratified random sampling. Firstly, individual risk factors (dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking) in population aged 25-64 years of age were monitored using questionnaires and physical and laboratory measurements; additionally, the cumulative effect of these risk factors in subjects was examined. Finally, cardiovascular risk in the age group of 40-64 years (767 out of 1057 participants) was estimated using the SCORE EU chart (for countries with high cardiovascular risk). Individual parameters were assessed according to standard criteria: dyslipidaemia = total cholesterol ≥5.0 mmol/l, and/or HDL-C < 1.0 mmol/l in men, or <1.2 mmol/l in women, and/or LDL-C ≥ 3.0 mmol/l and/or fasting TAG ≥ 1.7 mmol/l (or ≥2 mmol/l without fasting) and/or medication with lipid-lowering drugs; obesity = BMI > 30 kg/m2; hypertension = systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, and/or antihypertensive treatment; diabetes mellitus = HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol and/or on treatment. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Of the total number of 1057 study participants (426 men and 631 women) aged 25-64 years, roughly 84% presented with ≥1 cardiovascular disease risk factor. The most common risk factor was dyslipidaemia, which occurred in 71.7% of the subjects. The prevalence of hypertension was 36.3% (men 46.0%, women 26.3%). 29.7% of subjects were obese, diabetes mellitus occurred in 5.7% (men 7.6%, women 3.7%). 17.7% were regular smokers; another 6.6% reported occasional smoking. A combination of risk factors was common, e.g., 77.3% had dyslipidaemia and/or hypertension. There were 16.1% of subjects without monitored cardiovascular risk factors. After stratification of cardiovascular risk prediction according to SCORE chart, 49.7% of individuals fall into low risk, 28.6% into medium risk, and up to 11.3% into high and 10.4% into very high risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The most common risk factor is lipid spectrum disorders (71.7%). Combination of risk factors is common, which increases the risk of cardiovascular events in these individuals. In the 40-64 age group, 21.7% of the population is at >5% risk of a fatal cardiovascular event over the next 10 years.",2025,"['hdl - c', 'ldl - c', 'hba1c']",['hba1c']

Fat mass and obesity-associated protein inhibits macrophage-mediated inflammation via the m6A demethylation of c-Jun in COPD.,"Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), which is a key regulator of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification, is associated with inflammatory processes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent inflammatory disease that affects airways. However, the precise mechanism underlying the FTO-mediated regulation of inflammation in COPD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which FTO-mediated m6A RNA demethylation regulates macrophage-driven inflammation in COPD. Bioinformatics analysis of a GEO dataset (GSE148004) and validation in lung tissues revealed significant downregulation of FTO expression in patients with COPD (n = 10). Consistent with these findings, decreased FTO protein levels and a significant increase in global m6A methylation were observed in CSE-stimulated U937-derived macrophages (n = 3) and alveolar macrophages from mice with COPD (n = 6). Additionally, FTO overexpression attenuated CSE-induced IL-6 and TNF-α production by U937-derived macrophages (n = 3), and this overexpression alleviated emphysematous changes and airway inflammation in mice with COPD (n = 6). Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis revealed c-Jun as a downstream target of FTO. Mechanistically, FTO suppressed the m6A modification of c-Jun mRNA, leading to increased c-Jun mRNA degradation, thereby attenuating macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses (n = 3).

"Erchen Decoction Offers Health Benefits in Regulating Obesity: Component Analysis, Network Pharmacology, and Experiment Verification.","Erchen Decoction (ECT) is composed of six plants and fruits, with potential for treating metabolic diseases. However, its regulatory effects and material basis on simple obesity have not been reported. In this study, we predicted potential targets and pathways of ECT intervention on simple obesity through component analysis and network pharmacology. Subsequently, the predicted targets and regulatory pathways were validated via animal experiments. A total of 93 compounds were identified in ECT and 221 overlapping potential targets were identified between ECT and obesity. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the regulatory pathways of ECT may involve lipid metabolism, oxidative stress regulation, and immune modulation. Molecular docking experiments demonstrated that the main components of ECT, including Sachaliside, Naringenin, Liquiritigenin, maclurin, and Rhapontigenin, exhibited strong binding affinities with oxidative stress and immune markers. Animal experiments demonstrated that ECT has significant potential for weight loss and lipid-lowering effects, especially mitigating hepatic oxidative stress and systemic inflammation through the LPS-TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. This study provides fundamental data for the further development of ECT as a potential functional food for regulating simple obesity.",2025,"['e', 'ect', 'ect', 'ect', 'ect', 'ect', 'ect', 'tlr4', 'myd88', 'nf - κb', 'ect']","['tlr4', 'myd88']"
WW Domain-Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1 (WWP1) as a Factor in Obesity-Related Metabolic Disorders: Emerging Molecular Mechanisms in Metabolic Tissues.,"WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (WWP1) is a member of the homologous to E6AP C-terminus-type E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family. Although WWP1 plays a role in several human diseases, including infectious diseases, neurological disorders, and cancers, there is emerging evidence that WWP1 is also associated with metabolic disorders. In this review, we discuss the regulation and molecular function of WWP1 and its contribution to obesity-related metabolic disorders, particularly in white adipose tissue and the liver. We highlight the need for further research to deepen our understanding of how WWP1 may be implicated in metabolic dysfunction and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target WWP1.",2025,"['ww domain - containing e3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1', 'wwp1', 'e6ap c - terminus - type e3 ubiquitin protein', 'ligase family', 'wwp1', 'wwp1', 'wwp1', 'wwp1', 'wwp1']","['ww domain containing e3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1', 'wwp1']"
Notch signaling in metabolic diseases: A key regulator and potential target.,"The incidence of metabolic diseases, particularly obesity, has been rising annually, exerting a profound influence on global health, the economy, and society. Consequently, there is an urgent need to elucidate the pathogenesis of these diseases and develop effective therapeutic strategies. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell signaling that mediates cell-to-cell communication. It is well known for its regulatory role in cell fate determination, tissue development, and organogenesis. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrant activation of Notch signaling pathway can impair energy homeostasis and cause metabolic disorders, promoting the progression of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This review comprehensively summarizes the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological functions of the Notch signaling pathway in metabolic diseases, including obesity, NAFLD, NASH, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, Notch inhibition therapies are introduced to identify potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases.",2025,"['notch', 'notch', 'notch', 'notch']",['notch']
The biological function and research progress of the adipokine chemerin in tumorigenesis and development.,"Chemerin is a protein, encoded by the <i>RARRES2</i> gene, which has important roles in immune regulation, inflammation and metabolic regulation. Chemerin can affect the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of tumor cells and is important in the occurrence, development, metastasis, differentiation and development of tumors. CMKLR1, GPR1, and CCRL2, the primary cellular receptors for chemerin, can be found in both normal and tumor tissues. Chemerin binds to its receptors to influence tumor growth and metastasis by regulating the inflammatory response and tumor microenvironment.

The Role of p53 in Adipocyte Differentiation and Lipid Metabolism in Obese Mice via Transcriptional Regulation of Lgals3.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigates the regulatory role of p53 on Lgals3 expression and its impact on preadipocyte differentiation, fatty acid synthesis, and oxidation in obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Bioinformatics analysis of six obesity-related microarray datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data identified Lgals3 as a key obesity-associated gene. A high-fat diet (HF) mouse model was established to evaluate obesity-related phenotypes, including body weight, hepatic Lgals3 expression, adipose tissue pathology, blood lipid profiles, and glucose tolerance. In vitro experiments using 3T3-L1 cells were conducted to assess adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, and glucose uptake. The interaction between p53 and the Lgals3 promoter was analyzed via dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Key metabolic genes and proteins were quantified by RT-qPCR and Western blot.<h4>Results</h4>HF mice exhibited significant weight gain, elevated Lgals3 expression, and altered lipid profiles. In vitro, p53 was shown to transcriptionally repress Lgals3, thereby reducing adipocyte differentiation, FAS activity, and glucose uptake. In vivo, p53 overexpression led to downregulation of Lgals3 and improvement in obesity-related metabolic outcomes, whereas Lgals3 overexpression counteracted these effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>p53 inhibits Lgals3 expression, suppressing adipocyte differentiation and improving obesity-related metabolic dysfunction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in obesity management.",2025,"['p53', 'lgals3', 'lgals3', 'hepatic lgals3', 'fatty acid synthase', 'fas', 'p53', 'lgals3 promoter', 'luciferase reporter', 'lgals3', 'p53', 'lgals3', 'fas', 'p53', 'lgals3', 'lgals3', 'p53', 'lgals3']","['p53', 'lgals3', 'fatty acid synthase', 'fas']"
"The mechanism of probiotics in pregnancy outcomes in overweight or obese pregnant women based on meta-analysis, network pharmacology and molecular docking.","<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age is increasing worldwide. Obesity significantly increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The effectiveness of probiotics in improving the pregnancy outcomes of overweight or obese pregnant women is still controversial.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles up to May 30, 2025. Revman 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis. In network pharmacology, the gutMGene database was used to obtain the bioactive components of probiotics, and the SwissTargetPrediction platform was used to predict the targets of the active components. The related targets of diseases were obtained through OMIM and GeneCards databases and the bioactive compound-target network was constructed. AutoDockTools software was used for molecular docking verification.<h4>Results</h4>Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1563 participants were included in the meta-analysis.The results showed no significant difference between probiotic and control in improving adverse pregnancy outcomes.However, subgroup analyses indicated that the combination of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus significantly reduced the risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (RR = 0.54, 95% CI [0.30,0.96], P = 0.04). Network pharmacology identified 46 bioactive metabolites and 166 targets. The key bioactive metabolites of probiotics were arctigenin, aglycone, 10-Oxo-11-octadecenoic acid, doconexent, 10-keto-12Z-octadecenoic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, ponciretin, caffeic acid, and equol. The core targets were STAT3, ESR1, HSP90AA1, CCND1, AKT1, EGFR, BCL2, SRC, MTOR, and TP53. Molecular docking validated high-affinity interactions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings suggest that probiotics can improve some adverse pregnancy outcomes in overweight or obese pregnant women through multiple components, targets and pathways, and provide a basis for further research.

Neural Correlates Underlying General and Food-Related Working Memory in Females with Overweight/Obesity.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Prior research suggest that poor working memory significantly contributes to the growth of overweight and obesity. This study investigated the behavioral and neural aspects of general and food-specific working memory in females with overweight or obesity (OW/OB).<h4>Method</h4>A total of 54 female participants, with 26 in the OW/OB group and 28 in the normal-weight (NW) group, completed a general and a food-related two-back task while an EEG was recorded.<h4>Results</h4>In the general task, the OW/OB group showed significantly poorer performance (higher IES) than the NW group (<i>p</i> = 0.018, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.10), with reduced theta power during non-target trials (<i>p</i> = 0.040, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.08). No group differences were found for P2, N2, or P3 amplitudes. In the food-related task, significant group × stimulus interactions were observed. The OW/OB group showed significantly higher P2 amplitudes in high-calorie (HC) versus low-calorie (LC) food conditions (<i>p</i> = 0.005, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.15). LPC amplitudes were greater in the OW/OB group for HC targets (<i>p</i> = 0.036, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.09). Alpha power was significantly lower in OW/OB compared to NW in HC non-targets (<i>p</i> = 0.030, <i>η</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.09), suggesting a greater cognitive effort.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings indicate that individuals with OW/OB exhibit deficits in general working memory and heightened neural responses to high-calorie food cues, particularly during non-target inhibition. The results suggest an interaction between reward salience and cognitive control mechanisms in obesity.",2025,[],[]
Cancer prevention and interception with antidiabetic and anti-obesity drugs: Current and future perspectives.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and multiple malignancies, and epidemiology reveals an increasing burden of obesity-related cancers, in particular liver, pancreatic and endometrial. Obesity is also clearly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. Chronic hyperinsulinemia, systemic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation create a tumor-promoting environment, emphasizing the need for interventions that target metabolic health and can provide cancer prevention or interception. This review examines the potential cancer-preventive effects of antidiabetic and anti-obesity drugs, summarizing current preclinical and clinical evidence on their mechanisms and efficacy. Among these agents, metformin has been extensively studied, demonstrating anticancer properties through AMP-activated protein kinase activation, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition, and reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide and tirzepatide, promote weight loss, insulin sensitivity, and anti-inflammatory effects, with emerging evidence suggesting direct tumor-suppressive actions. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors modulate tumor metabolism by reducing glucose availability and mitigating systemic inflammation. Other agents, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, have shown mixed evidence regarding their potential anticancer effects, necessitating further investigation. While observational studies and meta-analyses suggest a potential reduction in cancer risk with certain antidiabetic and anti-obesity agents, randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cancer prevention are limited. Additionally, long-term safety concerns, including potential tumor-promoting effects in specific contexts, warrant further investigation. Future research should focus on large-scale clinical trials and mechanistic studies to validate the oncologic benefits and risks of these agents.",2025,"['amp - activated protein kinase', 'mammalian target', 'insulin - like growth factor 1', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'sodium - glucose cotransporter 2', 'dipeptidyl peptidase - 4', 'alpha - glucosidase']","['amp activated protein kinase', 'insulin like growth factor 1', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'dipeptidyl peptidase 4', 'alpha glucosidase']"
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Oxcarbazepine to Characterize Its Disposition in Children with Obesity.,"Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is a second-generation antiseizure medication, effective through its active metabolite, 10-mono-hydroxy derivative (MHD). OXC is used as adjunctive therapy for focal-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with recommended dosing based on age and body weight. This study uses physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and leverages pharmacokinetic (PK) data acquired from children enrolled in pragmatic trials to understand dosing and subsequent exposure requirements in children with obesity. Drug concentrations of OXC and MHD (n = 148 each) from children with (n = 31) and without (n = 10) obesity, aged 2-20 years, were collected from two clinical trials (NCT01431326 and NCT02993861) and used for external evaluation of a previously developed PBPK model of OXC using PK-Sim. We used a previously published virtual population that accounts for the obesity-related changes in physiology (e.g., liver size and glomerular filtration rate) in children for PK simulations in children with obesity. Model evaluation showed that ≥80% of MHD concentrations contributed by about two thirds of study subjects (26 out of 41) fell within the 90% prediction interval. The PBPK model showed that children with obesity had lower median (interquartile range) simulated weight-normalized clearance (0.060 L/h/kg [0.048-0.076 L/h/kg]) than children without obesity (0.067 L/h/kg [0.060-0.077 L/h/kg]). Simulations revealed that the recommended pediatric dosing regimen produced comparable MHD exposure between children with and without obesity at steady state, supporting its applicability regardless of obesity status. This PBPK-based dosing aligns with product label recommendations and demonstrates the potential of PBPK modeling for dosing other drugs in children with obesity.",2025,[],[]
"Monoamine oxidases are mediators of oxidative stress in human varicose Veins: interactions with obesity, inflammation, and angiotensin II.","Chronic venous disease (CVD) and its clinical manifestation, the varicose veins (VVs), are characterized by progressive structural and functional alterations of the venous walls, with obesity/overweight being one of the most frequent comorbidities. Monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) are mitochondrial flavoenzymes responsible for the constant generation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) during the catabolism of biogenic monoamines and neurotransmitters that contribute, when upregulated, to the oxidative stress in most mammalian tissues. However, their role in the VV pathophysiology and its modulation by vasoactive stimuli such as angiotensin II (Ang II) remains unclear. This exploratory study was double-aimed i) to assess MAO expression in human VV samples in relation to obesity and systemic inflammation and ii) to determine the impact of pharmacological MAO inhibition on oxidative stress under basal and Ang II-stimulated conditions. To this aim, 20 patients with VV and an indication for cryostripping were randomized according to their body mass index (BMI) into obese (n = 10) and non-obese (n = 10) groups, and VV samples were harvested and used to assess the following: i) MAO-A and MAO-B gene expression by qRT-PCR, as well as expression and localization by immunofluorescence, and ii) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by means of the ferrous xylenol orange oxidation (FOX) assay. Furthermore, the effect of selective MAO inhibition (clorgyline 10 μM for MAO-A, selegiline 10 μM for MAO-B) was tested ex vivo both at baseline and following acute stimulation with Ang II (100 nM). We showed that both MAO-A and MAO-B are constitutively expressed in the human venous walls, with higher levels in the varicose veins than in the adjacent perforator veins. The obese patients with inflammatory status (elevated serum C-reactive protein) had significantly increased MAO-A (but not MAO-B) expression as compared to the non-obese controls (p < 0.01). Acute ex vivo incubation with Ang II further enhanced the expression of both isoforms and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. MAO inhibition significantly mitigated the oxidative stress in both non-stimulated and Ang II-stimulated samples, regardless of the presence or absence of obesity. In conclusion, MAO isoforms, in particular MAO-A, are upregulated in the human varicose veins and can be further induced by Ang II, especially in the setting of obesity associated with low-grade inflammation. MAO contributed to the local oxidative stress, which was significantly reduced by its pharmacological inhibition with MAO-A and B inhibitors, thus pointing to MAO as a potential therapeutic target in patients with CVD.",2025,"['monoamine oxidases', 'mao - a', 'mao - b', 'an', '##giotensin ii', 'ang ii', 'mao', 'mao', 'ang ii', 'mao - a', 'mao - b gene', 'mao', 'mao - a', 'mao - b', 'ang ii', 'mao - a', 'mao - b', 'serum c - reactive protein', 'mao - a', 'mao - b', 'ang ii', 'mao', 'ang ii', 'mao', 'mao - a', 'ang ii', 'mao', 'mao - a and b', 'mao']","['monoamine oxidase', 'ang ii', 'mao']"
"Origin, Impact, and Solutions for Lifestyle-Related Diseases in Japan.","Japan is an archipelago west of the Pacific Ocean, facing decades of dietary and lifestyle westernization and its physiological consequences. Much like many other countries, Japan is tackling the global trend of lifestyle-related problems. This paper aims to discuss the current demographics in Japan and examine the origin and impact of lifestyle-related chronic diseases within the population. This review will highlight the nutritional transition during the country's development and examine the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of lifestyle-related diseases, primarily hypertension and obesity, in the context of traditional practices and cultural shifts. A combination of high salt intake in traditional cuisine and increased fat and sugar consumption from the westernization of the diet contributes to elevated blood pressures and obesity rates in Japan. This paper explores policy-based interventions, such as nutrient taxation and front-of-package labeling (FOPL), and their potential to mitigate these growing health concerns. One strategy is a nutrient tax to reduce the appeal of specific unhealthy products, such as sugar-sweetened beverages. Similarly, targeting alcohol with taxes and stricter regulations on advertising can reduce consumption. FOPL provides clear and concise nutritional information on the front of each product for consumers to make informed purchases. Expansion of blood pressure monitoring can allow patients to take a more proactive role in their own health, and providers can better tailor treatment plans. Increasing physical activity through workplace wellness programs can reduce the risk of chronic diseases and can be especially effective for Japanese office workers who tend to spend a lot of time in sedentary behavior. Collaboration amongst the government, businesses, and healthcare providers will be vital to empowering the general population to make healthy changes.",2025,[],[]
NRF2-REGγ-ACADM/KLF15 Signaling Pathway Regulates the Browning of White Adipose Tissue to Modulate Obesity.,"Obesity is a significant risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers, and manifests as excessive fat accumulation. The browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) represents one of the most promising strategies for preventing and treating obesity and metabolic diseases. To date, an increasing number of studies have focused on key molecular mechanisms regulating fat thermogenesis, laying the foundation for effective intervention strategies. Here, REGγ expression is shown to be significantly upregulated in adipose tissue of obese individuals and in inguinal WAT (iWAT) of obese mice. Deficiency in REGγ expression reduces fat deposition, increases energy expenditure in adipose tissue, and protects mice from HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, REGγ expression regulates browning of WAT by modulating ACADM and KLF15-UCP1 signaling in a ubiquitin-independent degradation manner. Overactivation of the NRF2-REGγ axis facilitates adipose tissue function to cause obesity. Notably, inhibition of REGγ in the iWAT alleviates HFD-induced obesity, thereby identifying REGγ as a latent target for obesity treatment. Together, the findings provide new targets for intervening in obesity and might ultimately offer new options for treating obesity.",2025,"['regγ', 'regγ', 'insulin', 'regγ', 'acadm', 'klf15', 'ucp1', 'u', '##biquitin', 'nrf2', 'regγ', 'regγ', 'regγ']","['reggamma', 'insulin', 'acadm', 'klf15', 'ucp1', 'nrf2']"
"The Bidirectional Role of Obesity and Aging in the Pathogenesis of Osteoarthritis: Molecular Mechanisms, Epigenetic Insights, and Therapeutic Implications.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major global contributor to pain, disability, and socioeconomic burden. With the increasing prevalence of obesity and an aging population, the incidence of OA continues to rise. This review explores the bidirectional relationship between obesity and aging in the pathogenesis of OA, focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms. Obesity contributes to aging by inducing oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation, thereby promoting OA development and progression. Conversely, the accumulation of senescent cells with age exacerbates obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic dysfunction by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and bioactive molecules. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the regulation of non-coding RNAs, play pivotal roles in modulating these interactions, further influencing OA progression. The review also discusses current and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the obesity-aging-OA axis, highlighting the potential of epigenetic interventions and novel anti-inflammatory treatments. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular interplay between obesity and aging in OA is essential for developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies. Future research should prioritize the in-depth exploration of epigenetic mechanisms, coupled with technological innovation, standardized education and training, quality control, and multidisciplinary collaboration. Targeted strategies and interventions are essential to effectively prevent and manage obesity- and OA-related diseases.",2025,['histone'],['histone']
The relationship between protein intake and body composition after bariatric surgery: Influence of sex and type of surgery.,"<h4>Background & aims</h4>Achieving the recommended protein intake (PI) is one of the main challenges of dietary monitoring in order to minimize fat-free mass (FFM) loss after bariatric surgery (BS). Protein supplementation is recommended to achieve this goal. However, the most appropriate PI recommendation scheme as regards amount and timing, as well as the relationship between PI and body composition after surgery, still needs to be studied. The aim of this study was to analyze PI and protein supplementation as well as their relationship with body composition during the first year after BS.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied a sample of 621 patients (195 males/426 females) who underwent BS (205 sleeve gastrectomy/416 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). Preoperative and first-year follow-up data of body composition, dietary intake and physical activity level were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Average PI was higher than 60 g/d but lower than 80 g/d at all time-points. Less than 10 % of patients achieved the target of 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight (IBW)/d. Women presented a higher PI expressed in g/kg of IBW/d in the first and three months after BS (P < 0.05) and in g/kg of FFM/d at all follow-up times (P < 0.001). Adherence to protein supplementation decreased over the first post-operative year. Supplementation was essential for women to achieve the minimum PI of 60 g/d 1 month after surgery. Men with a higher PI than 60 g/d during the first year exhibited a lower fat mass (FM)% and higher FFM% than those who did not achieve this target during all the follow-up points. This effect was not observed in women. The average physical activity increased significantly after BS (P = 0.01), observing a positive correlation between FFM% and PAL at months 1, 6 and 12 of the follow-up (P = 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Protein supplementation helps to achieve the minimum PI threshold indication of 60 g/d, but patients did not achieve the recommended intake of 1.5 g/kg of IBW/d. PI and its relationship with the evolution of body composition after BS is different depending on sex. More research is needed to increase knowledge about the most appropriate PI, supplementation scheme and its impact on body composition, taking into account factors such as sex and physical activity to personalize protein recommendations.",2025,[],[]
Examining the Role of Sleep in Body Weight Regulation and Implications for Obesity Treatment: A Narrative Review.,"Despite significant public health efforts to counter the obesity epidemic, approximately 50% of US adults will have obesity by 2030. The cornerstone of obesity treatment is a behavioral intervention promoting negative energy balance via a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Behavioral treatment also requires additional support to promote adherence to these recommended lifestyle changes. More recently, sleep has been recognized as an important component of body weight regulation due to its effects on physiological and behavioral determinants of energy balance. Therefore, sleep may represent a modifiable behavior to target during the behavioral treatment of obesity. This review summarizes existing clinical evidence on the influence of sleep on energy balance and body weight regulation in adults. The results of controlled laboratory studies as well as pragmatic clinical trials are reviewed. In addition, we identify existing gaps and future areas of research that are necessary to understand the role of sleep in behavioral treatments for obesity.",2025,[],[]
The Role of Obesity in the Regulation of Immunosuppressive Cell Infiltration and Immunosurveillance in Cancers.,"Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, causing about 10 million deaths annually. Obesity contributes to cancer progression by inducing chronic inflammation, immunosuppressive microenvironment, metabolic dysfunction, and therapeutic resistance. Accumulating evidence shows that obesity can advance the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and ameliorate the function and cytotoxicity of tumor-killing cells such as natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, macrophages, and CD8 T cells in cancer patients, resulting in cancer progression. Understanding the molecular signaling pathways involved in obesity-induced immunosuppression and cancer cell proliferation enables us to screen new biomarkers for cancer early diagnosis and improve anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy in obese patients with cancer. In this review, we first review the molecular mechanisms by which obesity induces the immunosuppressive landscape in the tumor microenvironment and some key obesity-associated factors causing immunotherapeutic suppression and metabolic dysfunction. Then, the application of natural products in the treatment of obesity and obesity-associated cancers is summarized. In addition, we discuss the contradictory functions of obesity in cancer risk and treatment outcome. The potent roles of precision medicine and artificial intelligence in the management of obesity-related cancers are highlighted.",2025,['cd'],[]
Dual-faced CXCL5 holds the key to unlocking immunotherapy in obese pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies, characterized by a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy. Obesity, a modifiable risk factor that increases PDAC incidence, exacerbates this immune evasion through metabolic inflammation and adipokine-driven signaling. Recent studies have implicated CXC chemokines, particularly CXCL5, as central mediators in shaping the immune landscape of PDAC. In a pivotal study, Walsh <i>et al</i> delineated a novel mechanism wherein adipocyte-derived cytokines (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor) induce tumor-derived CXCL5 expression, thereby promoting myeloid-driven immunosuppression in obese PDAC models. Their findings demonstrated that CXCL5 ablation enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration yet paradoxically increases monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell accumulation and arginase-1 expression, underscoring the complexity of chemokine signaling. Notably, only combinatorial targeting of CXCL5 and programmed cell death protein-1 yields therapeutic benefit, emphasizing the necessity of multiaxis interventions. This commentary synthesizes the mechanistic insights and translational implications of these findings, highlighting CXCL5 as a pivotal node linking metabolic dysfunction to immune resistance and a promising target for combinatorial immunotherapy in PDAC.",2025,"['cxcl5', 'interleukin - 1β', 'tumor necrosis factor', 'cxcl5', 'cxcl5', 'cd8', 'a', '##rginase - 1', 'cxcl5', 'programmed cell death protein - 1', 'cxcl5']","['cxcl5', 'tumor necrosis factor', 'cd8', 'programmed cell death protein 1']"
TNF as a mediator of metabolic inflammation and body-brain interaction in obesity-driven neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.,"Body-brain interaction (BBI) plays a critical role in coordinating the communication between peripheral organs and the brain, contributing to the comorbidity of metabolic disorders and neurological disorders. In the context of obesity, one of the key mediators driving systemic and neuroinflammatory responses is the soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which primarily signals through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) to regulate inflammation and cell death. In this review, we examine how TNF/TNFR1-mediated metabolic inflammation in obesity disrupts cellular homeostasis across multiple organ systems, including the brain. In peripheral tissues, TNF is overproduced and secreted by activated macrophages, leading to lipid dysmetabolism, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction in key cell types such as adipocytes and hepatocytes. Elevated circulating TNF also increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, enabling peripheral inflammatory mediators to infiltrate the brain and activate glial cells, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation. Within the brain, TNF induces metabolic and autolysosomal dysfunction in neurons, resulting in elevated reactive oxygen species, accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, and impaired insulin signaling, contributing collectively to neuronal death and the progression of neurodegeneration. We further highlight the metabolic-inflammatory crosstalk within the BBI as a potential therapeutic target, focusing on anti-inflammatory strategies that modulate TNF/TNFR1 signaling. Lastly, we provide future perspectives on the implications of body-brain axes, cell type-specific mechanisms, and disease comorbidities in the context of obesity.",2025,"['tumor necrosis factor', 'tnf', 'tnf receptor 1', 'tnfr1', 'tnf', 'tnfr1', 'tnf', 'insulin', 'tnf', 'tnf', 'insulin', 'tnf', 'tnfr1']","['tumor necrosis factor', 'tnf', 'tnfr1', 'insulin']"
Impact of Maternal Obesity on Offspring microRNA Profiles: A Systematic Review of Experimental Models.,"Maternal malnutrition, including obesity, can have long-term adverse effects on offspring health, potentially mediated by epigenetic mechanisms such as microRNAs (miRNAs). These miRNAs play a critical role in regulating gene expression and may contribute to the developmental programming of offspring outcomes. This systematic review aimed to explore the association between maternal obesity during pregnancy and miRNA alterations in offspring, focusing on evidence from animal models. A comprehensive search of the Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases identified 811 articles, 15 of which met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis revealed significant variability in the miRNAs and target tissues studied. Across the reviewed studies, 35 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in offspring exposed to maternal high-fat diet during pregnancy. These alterations were predominantly observed in the brain, liver, cardiac tissue, and adipose tissue, affecting processes related to insulin signaling, development and growth, immune response, and lipid metabolism. The observed miRNA alterations support the hypothesis that a maternal high-fat diet may induce a programmed epigenetic signature in offspring.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Obesity: A Modulator in Acne Management.,"Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory and multifactorial skin disease involving the sebaceous gland and the skin microbiome. Different exposome factors, including hormonal and family factors, have been suggested to influence acne. Obesity is an increasingly observed condition worldwide, and is considered as a public health problem by the World Health Organization. Recently, a high body mass index has been identified as an acne severity risk factor in adolescents. A group of 5 dermatologists from different institutions and private practices from France involved in the research and clinical fields of acne -analysed recent literature on ""obesity and acne"" focusing on epidemiology, the pathogenesis of acne and obesity, as well as the management of acne in obese patients. The authors selected, prior to their discussion in November and December 2024 and again in March 2025, and discussed 52 articles concerning acne and obesity published since 2000 and available from the PubMed database. The authors agreed that, considering these common metabolic features, managing both acne and obesity in parallel and helping patients through a global approach including dermatological, endocrinal, psychological and nutrition, as well as lifestyle support is mandatory, and may allow for the improvement of both acne and obesity. Moreover, in order to allow dermatologists to manage acne in obese patients in the most efficient way, the authors developed and propose a decision tree. The authors consider that acne in obese patients is not a fatality, and taking care of acne should not be considered an isolated task in this specific patient population.",2025,[],[]
"Genetic Deletion of RHAMM Alleviates Hepatic Oxidative Stress, Reversing Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Elevation in Male Obese Mice.","<b>Objective</b>: Obesity induces hypothyroidism with unknown mechanisms. This study investigates the role of (Receptor for Hyaluronan-Mediated Motility (RHAMM) in obesity-associated thyroid dysfunction, focusing on hepatic oxidative stress. <b>Methods</b>: Global RHAMM-deficient mice and their wildtype littermate controls were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The hepatic oxidative response was assessed by measuring signaling pathways associated with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity. <b>Results</b>: HFD feeding increased plasma TSH levels in male mice but not in female mice. RHAMM deletion in male mice mitigated HFD-induced TSH elevation, which was associated with enhanced hepatic antioxidant defenses and reduced inflammation. This was evidenced by elevated expression of the Nrf2 target gene NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), reduced protein carbonylation and nitration levels, and reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in livers of male RHAMM-deficient mice. Mechanistically, RHAMM deletion decreased AKT/ERK signaling, increased GSK3 signaling, increased CD44 protein expression, and increased Nqo1 levels in the liver. <b>Conclusions</b>: RHAMM promotes obesity-induced thyroid dysfunction by regulating oxidative stress and inflammation in male mice. Targeting RHAMM may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating obesity-related endocrine and metabolic disorders.",2025,"['h', '- mediated m', 'r', '##m', 'r', 'thyroid - stimulating hormone', 'tsh', 'nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor 2', 'nrf2', 'plasma tsh', 'rhamm', 'tsh', 'nrf2 target gene', 'nad ( p ) h : quinone oxidoreductase 1', 'nqo1', 'cytoki', 'il - 1β', 'tnf - α', 'r', 'rhamm', 'akt', 'erk', 'gsk3', 'cd44 protein', 'nqo1', 'r', 'rhamm']","['thyroid stimulating hormone', 'tsh', 'nrf2', 'rhamm', 'nqo1', 'akt', 'erk', 'gsk3']"
Synergistic alleviation of obesity and associated cardiovascular complications by combined modulation of FASN/Arginase/eNOS uncoupling.,"Globally and within Egypt, obesity fuels a growing health crisis, demanding novel therapeutic approaches rooted in systems medicine. This framework promotes the classification of diseases based on causal molecular mechanisms and use multi-target interventions to achieve synergistic effects within these pathways. Our previous research identified a dysregulated interaction among fatty acid synthase (FASN), arginase (ARG), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as a potential mechanistic driver of obesity and its sequelae. To address this, we designed a targeted therapeutic approach targeting malfunctioning at this dysfunctional FASN/ARG/eNOS network to enhance outcomes in obesity-related cardiovascular complications. We induced obesity in rats using a high-fructose, high-salt diet for 10 weeks, then randomized them into six groups: control, obese, and four obese treatment arms receiving orlistat (FASN inhibitor), norvaline (ARG inhibitor), citrulline/folic acid (eNOS recoupling), or their combination for 5 weeks. Although individual treatments offered benefits - orlistat reducing adiposity and improving some metabolic and cardiac markers, norvaline improving blood pressure (BP) and glycemic control, and citrulline/folic acid enhancing antioxidant defense and vascular function - the combined intervention yielded a striking synergistic effect. This multi-pronged approach most effectively reduced adiposity, normalized key metabolic parameters, conferred robust protection against cardiac remodeling (both structural and functional), significantly improved BP regulation, and modulated cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation. Our findings strongly indicate that simultaneously targeting the FASN/ARG/eNOS axis with mechanism-based therapies represents a novel and highly promising approach to comprehensively mitigate obesity and its devastating cardiovascular consequences.",2025,"['fatty acid synthase', 'fasn', 'arginase', 'arg', 'endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'enos', 'fasn', 'arg', 'enos', 'fasn', 'arg', 'enos', 'fasn', 'arg', 'enos']","['fatty acid synthase', 'fasn', 'arginase', 'arg', 'endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'enos']"
L-Theanine Alleviates High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity by Enhancing Hepatic Oxidative Phosphorylation and Remodeling Gut Microbiota to Augment Butyrate-Producing.,"Obesity represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating innovative therapeutic approaches. L-theanine, a bioactive component in tea, possesses diverse biological activities. This study investigates the anti-obesity mechanisms of L-theanine, focusing on its effects on lipid metabolism, energy expenditure, and gut microbiota using both in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, L-theanine (2 mM) reduced hepatocyte lipid content by downregulating lipogenic genes. In vivo, 12-week supplementation with L-theanine (30 and 100 mg/kg/day) dose-dependently decreased HFD-induced body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and serum triglycerides (TG) without altering food intake. Mechanistically, L-theanine disturbed the transcription of some key genes closely related to thermogenesis, lipid oxidation, and glycolipid metabolism, with hepatic transcriptomics confirming the enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation and thermogenic pathways. Critically, L-theanine also regulates gut microbiota, specifically increasing the abundance of Blautia and enhancing short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that L-theanine shows promise as a multi-target therapeutic agent for obesity, regulating lipid metabolism, enhancing energy expenditure, and maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis. However, its molecular targets, mechanisms, and human applicability still remain unclear.",2025,[],[]
GLP-1 Receptor Agonists vs Alternatives for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Multi-Target Trial Emulation,"<h4>Background</h4> Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise for alcohol use disorder (AUD). <h4>Objective</h4> To evaluate the association between use of newer GLP-1 RAs (semaglutide, tirzepatide) and alcohol-related hospitalizations among adults with AUD and either type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity. <h4>Methods</h4> This retrospective target trial emulation study used electronic health record data from Truveta to identify adults with AUD and either T2D or obesity, who initiated a newer GLP-1 RA (semaglutide, tirzepatide) or relevant active comparator between 2018 and 2024. Four target trials were constructed to reflect clinically distinct populations and comparators: (1) ADM trial (patients with T2D and comparators of other anti-diabetic medications [ADM]), (2) AOM trial (patients with obesity but not T2D and comparators of other anti-obesity medications [AOM]), (3) MAUD-T2D trial (patients with T2D and markers of more severe AUD and comparators of medications for alcohol use disorder [MAUD]), (4) MAUD-obesity trial (patients with obesity, no T2D, and markers of more severe AUD and comparators of MAUD). The primary endpoint was time to alcohol-related hospitalization. Non-alcohol-related hospitalization served as a negative control outcome. Propensity score-based methods (weighting and matching) were used to control for confounding. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment effect of newer GLP-1 RA in four target trials. <h4>Results</h4> A total of 40,260 patients were identified, including 18,515 in the ADM trial, 9,256 in the AOM trial, 9,975 in the MAUD and T2D trial, and 11,039 in the MAUD and obesity trial. GLP-1 RAs were associated with a lower hazard of alcohol-related hospitalization in the ADM (HR [95% CI]: 0.70 [0.59 - 0.83] vs. sulfonylureas; 0.73 [0.62 - 0.86] vs. other ADMs), AOM (HR: 0.59 [0.48 - 0.74]), MAUD-T2D (HR: 0.36 [0.29 - 0.46]), and MAUD-obesity (HR: 0.32 [0.23 - 0.43]) trials. No significant differences were observed for non-alcohol-related hospitalizations for ADM and MAUD-T2D trials. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Newer GLP-1 RAs were associated with reduced risk of alcohol-related hospitalization across clinically distinct populations.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ra', 'glp - 1 ra', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']

According to the FITT-VP principle, personalized resistance training programs were developed based on their individual health differences. The training was implemented in three stages with gradually increasing intensity from low to moderate. Each session lasted 40 min, 3 times a week, for a total of 36 weeks. Body composition, muscle function, and serum myokines (irisin, IGF-1, and myostatin) were tested before and after the intervention in both groups.<h4>Results</h4>The intervention yielded significant between-group improvements in body fat percentage (P < 0.05, Hedges' g = 1.42), ASMI (P < 0.01, Hedges' g = 1.79), HGS (P < 0.01, Hedges' g = 1.91), 6-metre walk speed (P < 0.01, Hedges' g = 1.36), five times sit-to-stand performance (P < 0.05, Hedges' g = 1.08), and TUG (P < 0.01, Hedges' g = 1.20). After 36 weeks, the exercise group also showed higher IGF-1 (P < 0.05, Hedges' g = 1.46) and lower MSTN (P < 0.01, Hedges' g = 1.02) levels compared to controls.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 36-week personalized resistance training program results in elevated serum IGF-1 concentrations and reduced myostatin levels, alongside independent improvements in muscle strength and muscle function among older women with probable sarcopenic obesity.",2025,"['irisin', 'igf - 1', 'myostatin', 'igf - 1', 'serum igf - 1', 'myostatin']","['irisin', 'myostatin']"
Combining evidence from human genetic and functional screens to identify pathways altering obesity and fat distribution.,"Overall adiposity and body fat distribution are heritable traits associated with altered risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality. Performing rare-variant (minor allele frequency <1%) association testing using exome-sequencing data from 402,375 participants of European ancestry in the UK Biobank for nine overall and tissue-specific fat distribution traits, we identified 19 genes where putatively damaging rare variation associated with at least one trait (Bonferroni-adjusted p < 1.58 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and 50 additional genes at false discovery rate (FDR) ≤1% (p ≤ 4.37 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). These 69 genes exhibited significantly higher (one-sided t test p = 3.58 × 10<sup>-18</sup>) common-variant prioritization scores for association with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, and body fat percentage than genes not significantly enriched for rare putatively damaging variation, with evidence of monotonic allelic series (dose-response relationships) among ultra-rare variants (minor allele count ≤10) in 22 genes. Combining rare and common variation evidence, allelic series and longitudinal analysis, we selected 14 genes for CRISPR knockdown in human white adipose tissue cell lines. In two target genes, knockdown significantly (two-sided t test p < 0.05/14) decreased lipid accumulation: PPARG (fold change [FC] = 0.25, p = 5.52 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and SLTM (FC = 0.51, p = 1.91 × 10<sup>-4</sup>); knockdown of COL5A3 (FC = 1.72, p = 0.0028) resulted in significantly increased lipid accumulation. Integrating across population-based genetic and in vitro functional evidence, we highlight therapeutic avenues for altering obesity and body fat distribution by modulating lipid accumulation.",2025,"['crispr', 'pparg', 's', '##m', 'col5a3']","['crispr', 'pparg', 'col5a3']"
"Discovery of BGM1812, a Novel Dual Amylin and Calcitonin Receptor Agonist for Obesity Treatment.","Parallel activation of the calcitonin receptor (CTR) and amylin receptor (AMYR) is considered a more effective weight-loss strategy. Although the novel dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist (DACRA), petrelintide, is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials, its agonistic activity remains insufficient compared with natural agonists. Further optimization of the agonistic capabilities of petrelintide is an attractive strategy for developing DACRAs. Due to the lack of structure-activity relationship (SAR) and target binding information, a step-by-step process involving three rounds of modifications was performed guided by structure-based drug design and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Two successful methylation strategies led to the identification of the more efficient novel DACRA, BGM1812, with excellent performance in terms of half-life, stability, and solubility. In both in vivo and in vitro studies, BGM1812 showed significantly enhanced efficacy. This finding provides valuable insights into the SAR of petrelintide and highlights the potential of BGM1812 as a promising obesity drug candidate.",2025,"['calcitonin receptor', 'ctr', 'amylin receptor', 'amyr', 'amylin', 'calcitonin receptor']","['calcitonin receptor', 'ctr', 'amylin receptor', 'amylin']"
The effect of cold exposure on energy expenditure of mice fed an obesogenic diet,"<h4>Objective</h4>  Cold exposure is one of the most powerful physiological stimuli for thermogenic adipose tissue activity and may positively impact metabolic homeostasis. An important gap in knowledge is whether mice with diet-induced obesity respond to cold similarly to their lean counterparts. The goal of the present study was to compare the response to cold exposure between mice fed a standard (normal-fat) diet and a higher-fat diet. <h4>Methods</h4>  Male C56BL/6J mice fed a standard diet (13.1% fat) or a higher-fat diet (21.6% fat) during adulthood and exposed to cold (4-6°C) following different approaches. Body weight, body composition, food intake, rectal temperature, energy expenditure, and respiratory exchange ratio were assessed. <h4>Results</h4>  Cold exposure significantly increased energy expenditure and limited weight gain despite elevated food intake in mice fed either a standard or a higher-fat diet, while body composition, body temperature, and respiratory exchange ratio remained stable across both dietary groups. Moreover, energy expenditure measured at 4-6 °C was comparable between mice fed standard and higher-fat diets, demonstrating that cold-induced thermogenesis may elicit a consistent metabolic response independent of dietary fat content. <h4>Conclusions</h4>  Our results demonstrated that cold exposure increased energy expenditure in both lean and obese animals, highlighting thermogenesis as a promising target for obesity treatment beyond current approaches focusing on appetite suppression. <h4>Highlights</h4>  Cold exposure increases energy expenditure and limits weight gain in both control diet and higher-fat diet-fed mice, despite increased food intake. Core body temperature and body composition remain stable during cold exposure, regardless of dietary fat content. Cold-induced thermogenesis elicits a comparable metabolic response in control diet and higher-fat diet-fed mice, supporting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity.",2025,[],[]
Genetic Pleiotropy Underlying Obesity and Autoimmunity Disorders: A Large-Scale Cross-Trait Genome-wide Association Analysis,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>We interrogate the joint genetic architecture of obesity and 17 autoimmune disorders through integrated cross-trait analysis, identifying 8 conditions with significant genetic correlations to obesity.

Specific targeting of adipose tissue metabolism is superior to caloric restriction in treating obesity-related HFpEF.,"Obesity is a modifiable major driver of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the most common and rapidly increasing form of heart failure. Current metabolic therapies, such as caloric restriction and incretin-based drugs, have shown promise in treating obesity-related HFpEF. However, these interventions neither specifically nor selectively improve adipose tissue metabolism, which is a key etiological factor in HFpEF that may offer a pathway to safer and more effective treatment strategies. Towards this end, we found that genetic inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) specifically in adipocytes is sufficient to prevent the development of obesity-related HFpEF, and that pharmacological inhibition of ATGL using atglistatin effectively treats established disease. Atglistatin selectively inhibits ATGL in adipose tissue, but not in the heart, leading to superior reduction in adiposity and greater improvement in diastolic dysfunction compared to caloric restriction. These observations underscore the therapeutic potential of selectively targeting adipose tissue, independent of the effects of body weight loss. Mechanistically, atglistatin attenuates HFpEF-associated elevation of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1β levels in adipose tissue, more effectively than caloric restriction. In sum, these findings identify dysregulated adipose tissue metabolism as a causal factor and therapeutic target in maladaptive fat-heart crosstalk driving obesity-related HFpEF.",2025,"['incretin', 'adipose triglyceride lipase', 'atgl', 'atgl', 'atglistatin', 'atglistatin', 'atgl', 'atglistatin', 'il - 1β']","['incretin', 'adipose triglyceride lipase', 'atgl', 'atglistatin']"
Obesity and Work in Abdominal Surgery.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent analyses have shown that Modifier 22 does not reimburse surgeons for the increased work required to care for the most complex patients. New strategies are needed to identify patients who require additional work to create a financial system that ensures equitable access. Obesity has been identified as a growing and potentially reliable patient risk factor that could be used to identify cases that require additional work.<h4>Study design</h4>Using 2022 American College of Surgeons NSQIP data, this study evaluated 10 common general surgery operations (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, colon/rectal operations, hernia repairs). The primary predictor was BMI category (normal: 18.5 to 25 kg/m 2 , overweight: 25 to 29.9 kg/m 2 , class I obesity: 30 to 34.9 kg/m 2 , class II obesity: 35 to 39.9 kg/m 2 , class III obesity 40 to 49.9 kg/m 2 , extreme obesity 50 kg/m 2 or more). Primary outcomes were operative time and composite measures of complications.<h4>Results</h4>The final sample included 158,692 operations. Across the entire cohort, 22.2% were normal weight and 76.3% were overweight or obese. Overall, operative time was increased by 5.6% (95% CI 4.8% to 6.3%) for overweight, by 10.6% (95% CI 9.8% to 11.5%) for class I obesity, by 14.7% (95% CI 13.6% to 15.8%) for class II obesity, by 18.9% (95% CI 17.6% to 20.2%) for class III obesity, and by 26.8% (95% CI 14.1% to 29.6%) for extreme obesity compared with those with normal BMI. Obesity was associated with higher odds of any complication or serious complication, driven by wound complications, pulmonary emboli, and renal insufficiency.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Obesity is a growing challenge in abdominal surgery and is associated with an increase in operative time and risk of complications. The consistency of the magnitude of effect makes it an ideal target for a modifier or add-on code that could identify cases requiring additional work.",2025,[],[]
Investigation of the potential of phytochemicals derived from citrus peels to inhibit digestive enzymes: an overture to the management of lifestyle diseases.,"The food industry relies on citrus fruits for juice, canned fruit, and jam, creating significant waste from peels, seeds, and pomace.

Leveraging Natural Compounds for Pancreatic Lipase Inhibition via Virtual Screening.,"<b>Background</b>: Pancreatic lipase (PL), the principal enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of dietary triacylglycerols in the intestinal lumen, is pivotal for efficient lipid absorption and plays a central role in metabolic homeostasis. Enhanced PL activity promotes excessive lipid assimilation and contributes to positive energy balance, key pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the escalating global prevalence of obesity-a complex, multifactorial condition strongly associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Inhibition of pancreatic lipase (PL) constitutes a well-established therapeutic approach for attenuating dietary lipid absorption and mitigating obesity. <b>Methods</b>: With the aim to identify putative PL inhibitors, a Structure-Based Virtual Screening (SBVS) of PhytoHub database naturally occurring derivatives was performed. A refined library of 10,404 phytochemicals was virtually screened against a crystal structure of pancreatic lipase. Candidates were filtered out based on binding affinity, Lipinski's Rule of Five, and structural clustering, resulting in six lead compounds. <b>Results</b>: In vitro, enzymatic assays confirmed theoretical suggestions, highlighting Pinoresinol as the best PL inhibitor. Molecular dynamics simulations, performed to investigate the stability of protein-ligand complexes, revealed key interactions, such as persistent hydrogen bonding to catalytic residues. <b>Conclusions</b>: This integrative computational-experimental workflow highlighted new promising natural PL inhibitors, laying the foundation for future development of safe, plant-derived anti-obesity therapeutics.",2025,"['pancreatic lipase', 'pl', 'pl', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pl', 'pl', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pl', 'pl']",['pancreatic lipase']
Immuno-metabolic diseases and therapeutics: molecular mechanisms via inflammasome signaling.,"Inflammatory responses serve as essential defense mechanisms in living organisms, but persistent or excessive activation can contribute to the development of chronic metabolic diseases. A central regulator of such inflammation is the inflammasome, a cytosolic multiprotein complex that senses pathogenic or stress-related signals and triggers the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). While inflammasome-induced pyroptosis, a form of lytic cell death, can play protective roles in pathogen clearance, excessive or dysregulated activation is more commonly associated with chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Increasing evidence points to the involvement of inflammasomes, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome, in the pathogenesis of immune-metabolic diseases that characterized by the interplay between immune dysfunction and metabolic imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and sarcopenia. In these conditions, aberrant inflammasome activity contributes to insulin resistance, lipid dysregulation, muscle wasting, and vascular injury through sustained cytokine release and immune cell recruitment. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of how inflammasome signaling is integrated into the molecular landscape of metabolic disease, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and highlighting inflammasomes as viable therapeutic targets. This review provides an updated overview of inflammasome biology, defines their role in four representative immune-metabolic diseases, and discusses recent progress in targeting inflammasome pathways as a strategy to mitigate chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.",2025,"['interleukin - 1β', 'il - 1β', 'interleukin - 18', 'il - 18', 'n', '##lrp3', 'insulin']","['interleukin 18', 'insulin']"
Role of the Th2-like Immune Response in Obesity: IL-4 as a Metabolic Regulator and IL-13 as an Effector of Muscle Energy Metabolism.,"The Th2 immune response, associated with allergic diseases and helminth infections, has emerged as a significant modulator of metabolic processes in adipose and liver tissues. Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, regulate energy metabolism, insulin resistance, and obesity-related issues. IL-4 and IL-13 play significant roles, while IL-5 mainly recruits eosinophils in visceral fat. IL-4 influences lipid metabolism via STAT6, promoting adipogenesis, lipolysis, and reducing leptin levels, thereby improving insulin resistance or inducing white adipose browning in the absence of leptin. IL-13 affects glucose metabolism by lowering gluconeogenesis and enhancing glucose control and increases energy expenditure in muscles during exercise via STAT3. Emerging therapies include recombinant cytokines, exosomes, and monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-4/IL-13 or IL-5, which are mostly approved for the treatment of allergic diseases. Their use in metabolic disorders is largely unexplored. Overall, Th2 cytokines are promising targets for obesity and metabolic diseases but require dedicated trials to assess benefits and risks.",2025,"['il - 4', 'il - 5', 'il - 13', 'insulin', 'il - 4', 'il - 13', 'il - 5', 'il - 4', 'stat6', 'leptin', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'il - 13', 'stat3', 'il - 4', 'il - 13', 'il - 5']","['il 13', 'insulin', 'stat6', 'leptin', 'stat3']"

Nanomedicine targeting PPAR in adipose tissue macrophages improves lipid metabolism and obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction.,"Excess body fat leads to an overabundance of adipose tissue macrophages (AT MΦs) with altered phenotypes that play pathogenic roles in obesity comorbidities including diabetes and cancer. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are leading targets to modulate AT MΦ phenotype. Here, we developed a dextran-based nanomedicine that delivers PPARα/γ agonists to AT MΦs and improves obesity and diabetic phenotypes in vivo. Within 1 week of treatment, AT MΦs decreased and became lipid laden, while extracellular vesicles secreted from AT decreased and reduced in lipid content. Within 2 weeks, glucose tolerance returned to levels of lean controls, followed by weight loss and reduced food intake. After 4 weeks, AT browning and amelioration of hepatic steatosis were evident. The physiological shifts were reproducible in three rodent models of obesity, spanning sexes and gonadal status. Effects were enhanced for the targeted nanomedicine compared with free drugs at equivalent doses, supporting the hypothesis that targeted PPAR activation in AT MΦs benefits systemic metabolism.",2025,"['peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors', 'ppars', 'pparα / γ', 'ppar']","['peroxisome proliferator activated receptors', 'ppar']"
Targeting adipocyte differentiation with CRT0066101: activation of AMPK signaling in 3T3-L1 cells.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation resulting from adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, with adipocyte differentiation being a central process driving these changes.<h4>Methods</h4>The anti-adipogenic effects of CRT0066101 (CRT), a pan-protein kinase D (PKD) inhibitor, were evaluated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Potential drug targets of CRT were predicted using network pharmacology analysis. The expression of adipocyte-specific genes and proteins was assessed by western blotting and qRT-PCR. To examine the involvement of the AMPK pathway, cells were co-treated with CRT and the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.<h4>Results</h4>CRT significantly inhibited early-stage adipocyte differentiation, reduced lipid accumulation, and downregulated key adipogenic transcription factors, including PPARγ and C/EBPα. Mechanistically, CRT activated the AMPK pathway, a known negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation.

Herein, ginger-derived exosomes (G-Exos) loaded with berberine (G-Exos@B) to facilitate targeted delivery to the liver through the formation of GR-Exos@B via the coalescence of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)-introduced liposomes (RAL) for effective NASH intervention are developed. The introduction of G-Exos significantly equipped GR-Exos@B to effectively overcome the multi-intestinal barrier, facilitating their exit from the cell in an intact form. Interestingly, the hepatic-targeting of RAL allowed GR-Exos to penetrate the liver more effectively than G-Exos, resulting in 2.39-fold greater accumulation in the liver. In vivo experiments revealed that dual ROS depletion by berberine and GR-Exos synergistically enhanced the therapeutic effect against inhibited oxidative stress and hepatocellular steatosis compared to GR-Exos. Additionally, the macrophage-targeting capability of G-Exos is leveraged to suppress the activation of hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome complexes, transitioning from an M1 pro-inflammatory to an M2 anti-inflammatory state, which helped diminish hepatic macrophage levels and subsequently reduce lipid accumulation. Meanwhile, GR-Exos@B improved insulin sensitivity primarily by strengthening the AMPK/AKT/IRS-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting GSK3-β function. Hence, GR-Exos@B shows promise as a potential strategy for alleviating obesity-induced NASH therapy.",2025,"['g - exos @ b', 'gr - exos @ b', 'g - exos', 'gr - exos @ b', 'gr - exos', 'g - exos', 'gr - exos', 'gr - exos', 'g - exos', 'hepatic nlrp3 in', '##lammas', 'complexes', 'gr - exos @ b', 'insulin', 'ampk', 'akt', 'irs - 1', 'gsk3 - β', 'gr - exos @ b']","['insulin', 'ampk', 'akt']"
Maternal Factors Related to Childhood Obesity in Ghana: A Scoping Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity has emerged as a significant public health issue globally, with one-quarter of obese children living in Africa. Maternal factors have been linked with childhood obesity, yet there is limited research in Ghana.<h4>Objective</h4>This scoping review examined maternal factors associated with childhood obesity in Ghana.<h4>Methods</h4>This review was conducted using the framework by Arksey and O'Malley. The strategy involved searching electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) and reference lists of relevant literature. Additional searches were performed using Google Scholar. Keywords, including maternal factors, childhood obesity, and Ghana, with their synonyms and related Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, were combined using Boolean operators. Peer-reviewed articles investigating maternal factors in relation to obesity in children in Ghana were included.<h4>Results</h4>The scoping review included 11 studies conducted between 2012 and 2022 with 8101 children between 4 and 17 years old. The prevalence of childhood obesity was between 2.3% and 21.2%. Higher socioeconomic status was consistently associated with a higher risk of childhood obesity. Several studies also found a positive association between maternal education and childhood obesity. Other maternal factors, including BMI and empowerment, have been less frequently studied.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Contrary to results from the developed countries, Ghanaian children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and with more educated mothers are more prone to obesity, highlighting the need to specifically target these families in obesity prevention and intervention strategies.",2025,[],[]
Targeting the Gut Microbiota in Pediatric Obesity: A Paradigm Shift in Prevention and Treatment? A Comprehensive Review.,"Pediatric obesity represents a growing global health challenge, closely associated with increased cardiometabolic risk and long-term adverse outcomes. Although lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of treatment, sustained success is often limited. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota (GM) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of obesity, influencing host metabolism, energy homeostasis, and systemic inflammation. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the complex interplay between GM and pediatric obesity, with a particular emphasis on microbiota-targeted interventions. These include probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, dietary modulation, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Findings from preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials indicate that gut dysbiosis may contribute to obesity-related mechanisms, such as altered nutrient absorption, increased adiposity, and dysregulated appetite control. Interventions targeting the microbiota have shown promise in modulating inflammatory pathways and improving metabolic profiles. While preliminary findings underscore the potential of the GM as a novel adjunctive target in managing pediatric obesity, current evidence remains heterogeneous, and robust clinical pediatric data are limited. Further research is needed to clarify the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes of microbiota-modulating strategies in children with obesity.",2025,[],[]
Nuclear Fetuin-A Drives Adipocyte Senescence via HIF-1α During Obesity,"Fetuin-A (FetA), a liver derived glycoprotein, has emerged from genome-wide association studies and epidemiological surveillance as a serum biomarker linked to obesity-driven type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), primarily due to its contribution to adipose tissue dysfunction. Here, we uncovered an eccentric role of nuclear FetA in visceral white adipocytes of obese T2D conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) facilitates the nuclear translocation of FetA via direct interaction, a process that promotes the emergence of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). While nuclear co-localization of FetA and HIF-1α strongly promotes adipocyte senescence, silencing FetA alone is sufficient to prevent senescence, even in conditions of HIF-1α overexpression or lipid-rich hypoxic stress. Although nuclear FetA does not directly bind to DNA, it enhances HIF-1α transcriptional activity, potentiating the activation of senescence markers such as β-galactosidase and p53. Selective knockdown of FetA in obese mice notably reduced adipocyte senescence in visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) and improved fasting glycemic control. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized nuclear function for FetA in orchestrating adipocyte senescence in obesity, establishing nuclear FetA as a potential therapeutic target for obesity related metabolic diseases.",2025,"['fetuin - a', 'feta', 'nuclear', 'feta', 'hypoxia - inducible factor - 1α', 'hif - 1α', 'feta', 'feta', 'hif - 1α', 'feta', 'hif - 1α', 'nuclear feta', 'hif - 1α', 'β - galactosidase', 'p53', 'feta', 'feta', 'nuclear feta']","['fetuin a', 'feta', 'p53']"
"An Integrated AI Framework for Occupational Health: Predicting Burnout, Long COVID, and Extended Sick Leave in Healthcare Workers.","<h4>Background</h4>Healthcare workers face multiple, interlinked occupational health risks-burnout, post-COVID-19 sequelae (Long COVID), and extended medical leave. These outcomes often share predictors, contribute to each other, and, together, impact workforce capacity. Yet, existing tools typically address them in isolation.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study to develop and deploy an integrated, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework that predicts these three outcomes using the same structured occupational health dataset, enabling unified workforce risk monitoring.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed data from 1244 Romanian healthcare professionals with 14 demographic, occupational, lifestyle, and comorbidity features. For each outcome, we trained a separate predictive model within a common framework: (1) a lightweight transformer neural network with hyperparameter optimization, (2) a transformer with multi-head attention, and (3) a stacked ensemble combining transformer, XGBoost, and logistic regression. The data were SMOTE-balanced and evaluated on held-out test sets using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, with 10,000-iteration bootstrap testing for statistical significance.<h4>Results</h4>The stacked ensemble achieved the highest performance: ROC AUC = 0.70 (burnout), 0.93 (Long COVID), and 0.93 (extended leave). The F1 scores were >0.89 for Long COVID and extended leave, whereas the performance gains for burnout were comparatively modest, reflecting the multidimensional and heterogeneous nature of burnout as a binary construct. The gains over logistic regression were statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for Long COVID and extended leave; <i>p</i> = 0.0355 for burnout). The SHAP analysis identified overlapping top predictors-tenure, age, job role, cancer history, pulmonary disease, and obesity-supporting the value of a unified framework.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We trained separate models for each occupational health risk but deployed them in a single, real-time web application. This integrated approach improves efficiency, enables multi-outcome workforce surveillance, and supports proactive interventions in healthcare settings.",2025,[],[]
Missing the Target: A Scoping Review of the Use of Percent Weight Loss for Obesity Management.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>To co-create comprehensive targets for obesity management, we need to understand the genesis and current use of percent weight loss targets in research. The goals of our scoping review are to (1) synthesize the literature on percent weight loss targets for adults with obesity and (2) discuss the percent weight loss targets in context with their health benefits.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for English language, pharmaceutical, and/or behavioral intervention studies in adults with obesity where the explicit aim of the study was weight reduction defined as a percent of body weight. Reviewers screened citations and extracted data including study characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>From 16,164 abstracts, we included 30 citations which were mostly randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 17) or quasi-experimental studies (n = 12) published between 1992 and 2024. Most of the studies had target weight loss goals between 3% and 10% of body weight (n = 28), while n = 2 had body weight loss goals of 15% or 30%. The proportion of participants who met the percent weight loss target ranged from 5.9% (nutrition only study) to 85% (pharmaceutical study). The studies reported different reasons for targeting a percentage of weight loss such as disease-specific outcomes, reduced risk of disease, or patient-reported outcomes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Percent weight loss targets were based on similar research and were often not feasible nor sustainable for most participants. The design of these interventions and evaluation of obesity management would benefit from more patient-focused parameters which could help to co-design comprehensive targets for research and practice.",2025,[],[]
Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in pediatric obesity and metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease.,"This article examines the growing prevalence of pediatric obesity and its connection to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in children and adolescents, focusing on the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in treatment. Pediatric obesity and MASLD present significant long-term health risks, making early intervention crucial. The article reviews the pathophysiology of both pediatric obesity and MASLD, explores current therapeutic strategies, and discusses the emerging role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, such as liraglutide, semaglutide, exenatide, and dulaglutide, in managing obesity, as well as explores current limited pediatric literature on the use of these medications in MASLD.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
"Intensity, Duration, and Context Dependency of the Responses to Nutrient Surplus and Deprivation Signaling in the Heart: Insights Into the Complexities of Cardioprotection.","Nutrient surplus sensing through PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) stimulates anabolism to expand cellular mass, whereas nutrient and energy deprivation sensing through SIRT1 (sirtuin-1) and AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) promotes catabolism to support cytoprotective quiescence. By signaling through downstream effectors (PGC-1α [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha], PPARα/PPARγ, FoxO1 [forkhead box protein family O1], NRF2 [nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2], HIF-1α [hypoxia-inducible factor-1α], and HO-1 [heme oxygenase-1]), environmental nutrients, growth factors, and cellular stress influence mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagic flux, cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyocyte senescence and apoptosis. Despite these canonical descriptions, the actual response to each effector is determined by the intensity and duration of signaling. Typically, transient and measured signaling produces adaptive effects, whereas continuous heightened activity yields maladaptive responses. The effects of signaling are also influenced by context; ie, the nature and intermittency of the external stress and the characteristics of the underlying substrate (eg, cardiomyopathy, obesity, or aging). PI3K signaling promotes physiological hypertrophy and is cardioprotective during abrupt cardiac stress, but its sustained activation accelerates pathological hypertrophy related to obesity and aging. Signaling through SIRT1/AMPK (and upregulation of autophagic flux) exerts favorable effects during exercise training and in chronic cardiomyopathy, obesity, and aging, but it undermines the cardiac response to abrupt stress. Intermittent FoxO1 upregulation may promote physiological hypertrophy while antagonizing pathological hypertrophy, but prolonged activation leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. NRF2 exerts antioxidant effects when background autophagic flux is vigorous but aggravates cellular stress when autophagy is suppressed (as in pathological hypertrophy). Sustained activation of PPARγ, NRF2, and HIF-1α in nutrient surplus states can lead to maladaptive ventricular remodeling, thus explaining the results of clinical trials with thiazolidinediones, bardoxolone, and prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. The influence of duration, intensity, and context may be mediated (in part) by the activation or suppression of counterregulatory mechanisms, by the selective recruitment of corepressors, and by posttranslational protein modifications. These observations, considered collectively, suggest that no protein or cellular process viewed in isolation can be regarded as cardioprotective or maladaptive. Cell signals operate usefully if they are delivered as part of an orchestrated program of compartmentalized nuanced bursts, acting as elements of multifaceted oscillating systems whose periodicity is determined by the need to achieve homeostasis.",2025,"['pi3k', 'phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase', 'mtor', 'me', 'target of rapamy', 'sirt1', 'sirtuin - 1', 'ampk', 'adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase', 'pgc - 1α', 'peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 - alpha', 'pparα', 'pparγ', 'foxo1', 'forkhead box protein family o1', 'nrf2', 'nuclear factor erythroid - derived factor 2', 'hif - 1α', 'hypoxia - inducible factor - 1α', 'ho - 1', 'heme oxygenase - 1', 'pi3k', 'sirt1', 'ampk', 'foxo1', 'nrf2', 'pparγ', 'nrf2', 'hif - 1α', 'prolyl hydroxylase']","['pi3k', 'phosphoinositide 3 kinase', 'mtor', 'sirt1', 'sirtuin 1', 'ampk', 'peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha', 'pparalpha', 'pparγ', 'foxo1', 'nrf2', 'heme oxygenase 1', 'prolyl hydroxylase']"
Association of GLP1RAs with risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evidence from drug target Mendelian randomization.,"<h4>Background</h4>Glucose-lowering glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. However, their potential benefits in pulmonary diseases remain unclear. To address this, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal effects of genetically proxied GLP1RAs on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and related conditions, including bronchitis and asthma.<h4>Methods</h4>We selected cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) as instrumental variables to genetically proxy GLP1RAs. Summary-level data were obtained from the eQTLGen and FinnGen consortia. MR analyses were used to identify the association between genetically proxied GLP1RAs and COPD, as well as COPD-related diseases. T2D, HbA1c levels, and BMI were used as positive controls.<h4>Results</h4>After Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing, MR analyses indicated that genetically predicted GLP1RAs were significantly associated with lower risks of COPD (OR [95% CI] = 0.838 [0.74-0.948], P = 0.013), early-onset COPD (< 65 years) (OR [95% CI] = 0.751[0.622-0.906], P = 0.01), COPD-related respiratory insufficiency (OR [95% CI] = 0.720[0.55-0.944], P = 0.024), acute bronchitis (OR [95% CI] = 0.787 [0.693-0.893], P = 0.002), asthma (OR [95% CI] = 0.872 [0.782-0.973], P = 0.023), and other symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems (OR [95% CI] = 0.426 [0.217-0.834], P = 0.023). No significant association was observed for later-onset COPD (≥ 65 years) (OR [95% CI] = 0.921 [0.783-1.082], P = 0.315) or chronic bronchitis risk (OR [95% CI] = 0.950 [0.889-1.016], P = 0.146).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Genetically predicted GLP1RAs are associated with a lower risk of early-onset COPD, COPD-related respiratory insufficiency, acute bronchitis, and asthma. These findings highlight potential benefits of GLP1RAs in T2D patients with coexisting pulmonary diseases and support the need for further investigation in COPD management.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp1ras', 'glp1ras', 'glp1ras', 'glp1ras', 'hba1c', 'glp1ras', 'glp1', 'glp1']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'hba1c', 'glp1']"
MTCH2 modulates CPT1 activity to regulate lipid metabolism of adipocytes.,"Metabolic disorders, including obesity and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis, arise from a chronic energy surplus. Thus, enhancing energy dissipation through increased respiration holds significant therapeutic potential for metabolic disorders. Through a comprehensive analysis of human and murine adipose tissues, along with a functional screen, we identify mitochondrial carrier homolog 2, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, as a pivotal regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. Intriguingly, its expression in adipose tissue is a strong determinant of obesity in humans. Adipocyte-specific ablation of mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 improves mitochondrial function and whole-body energy expenditure, independent of uncoupling protein 1. Furthermore, mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 regulates mitochondrial influx of free fatty acids by modulating the sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 to malonyl-CoA through direct physical interaction, leading to enhanced energy expenditure in adipocytes/adipose tissue. Here we show mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 functions as a negative regulator of energy metabolism in adipocytes and represents a potential target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.",2025,"['mitochondrial carrier homolog 2', 'outer membrane protein', 'mitochondrial carrier homolog 2', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'mitochondrial carrier homolog 2', 'carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1', 'mitochondrial carrier homolog 2']","['mitochondrial carrier homolog 2', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'carnitine palmitoyltransferase i']"
SHANK3 Deficiency in AgRP Neurons Inhibits Diet-Induced Obesity by Activating p38α.,"Children with autism often exhibit abnormalities in body weight, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 (SHANK3), a scaffold protein of the postsynaptic density, has been reported to be associated with autism. This study aimed to investigate whether and how SHANK3 influences body weight in the hypothalamic neuronal regulation of energy homeostasis. Adeno-associated viruses 9 (AAV9) carrying CMV-Cre and Agrp-Cre were stereotactically injected to restore SHANK3 expression in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, respectively. Agrp-Cre mice were injected with AAV9-p38α<sup>flox/flox</sup> to overexpress p38α. Activated p38α was generated by mutating both D176A and F327S in p38α. Inactivated p38α was constructed by mutating both T180A and Y182F in p38α. Metabolic analysis, immunoblotting, histological analysis, the glucose tolerance test, the insulin tolerance test, and body fat mass analysis were applied to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which SHANK3 regulates body weight. We reveal that SHANK3 regulates body weight via the p38α signaling pathway in the AgRP neurons of the hypothalamus. Shank3 knockout (Shank3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity. Shank3 re-expression in the ARC or AgRP neurons increases body weight in Shank3 knock-in mice with an inverted allele (SKO). Overexpression or activation of p38α in AgRP neurons elicits resistance to diet-induced obesity. Inactivated p38α in AgRP neurons abolished the resistance to diet-induced obesity due to SHANK3 deficiency. Our findings suggest that the SHANK3-p38α siganling pathway in AgRP neurons regulates body weight balance in autism, revealing a promising therapeutic target for obesity in children with autism.",2025,"['sh3', 'ankyrin repeat domains protein 3', 'shank3', 'shank3', 'agrp', 'shank3', 'agouti - related peptide', 'agrp', 'agrp', 'p38α', 'p38α', 'p38α', 'p38α', 'p38α', 'p38α', 'insulin', 'shank3', 'shank3', 'p38α', 'shank3', 'shank3', 'shank3', 'a', 'shank3', 'sko', 'p38α', 'ag', 'p38α', 'ag', 'shank3', 'shank3', 'p38α', 'a']","['shank3', 'agrp', 'insulin']"
miR-221-3p Exacerbates Obesity-Induced Insulin Resistance by Targeting SOCS1 in Adipocytes.,"<b>Objective:</b> Insulin resistance (IR) is a complex and multifactorial disorder that contributes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in diverse developmental and disease processes. However, the molecular mechanisms of IR are unclear. This paper aims to explore the role of miRNA in regulating IR and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for these effects. <b>Methods:</b> IR models were created by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) to mice or stimulating 3T3-L1 cells with palmitate. Twelve weeks of HFD trigger weight gain, leading to lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in mice. The expression profiles of miRNAs in adipose tissues (AT) from the HFD-induced mouse models were analyzed. The relationship between miR-221-3p and SOCS1 was determined using dual luciferase reporter gene assays. Metabolic alterations in AT were investigated by real-time PCR and Western blot. <b>Results:</b> miR-221-3p was significantly increased in AT. HFD-induced disturbances in glucose homeostasis were aggravated by miR-221-3p upregulation. The inhibition of miR-221-3p promoted insulin sensitivity including reduced lipid accumulation and the disruption of glucose metabolism. Of note, the 3'-UTR of SOCS1 was found to be a direct target of miR-221-3p. The SOCS1 inhibitor attenuated miR-221-3p-induced increases in IRS-1 phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylation, and GLUT4. miR-221-3p was considered to be involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thus leading to increased insulin sensitivity and decreased IR in HFD-fed mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. <b>Conclusions:</b> The miR-221-3p/SOCS1 axis in AT plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, providing a novel target for treating IR and diabetes.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'socs1', 'luciferase reporter gene', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'insulin', 'socs1', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'socs1', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'irs - 1', 'akt', 'glut4', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'pi3k', 'a', '##kt', 'insulin', 'mir - 221 - 3p', 'socs1']","['insulin', 'socs1', 'akt', 'glut4', 'pi3k']"
"Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults living with concurrent type 1 diabetes and overweight or obesity (TZP-T1D): a double-blind, placebo-matched randomised controlled trial protocol.","<h4>Introduction</h4>The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) complicates glycaemic management and escalates insulin resistance, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. Tirzepatide, a dual agonist for glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors, shows promise in managing weight and glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes but is unexplored in the context of T1D. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial will evaluate the efficacy of tirzepatide in adults with T1D and overweight/obesity over 32 weeks.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>60 participants (aged 18-70 years) with a body mass index ≥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and HbA1c≤10% will be randomised 1:1 to receive either tirzepatide or a placebo, alongside standard insulin therapy. The primary outcome is the change in body weight (%). Secondary measures include change in HbA1c (%), proportion of body weight lost (>5%, >10%, >15% and >20%), changes in insulin dosage, time in range by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) criteria and severity of comorbidities. Compliance, adverse events and medication interactions will be closely monitored, with adjustments made for tolerability. Patient-reported outcomes and experiences will be measured to capture the benefits of glycaemic management, weight management and quality of life. To compare the means of body weight reduction (%) between the tirzepatide and control groups, an independent samples t-test will be employed under the assumption that data are normally distributed. Secondary outcome measures will be analysed by Student's t-test. All data will be reported as group means with confidence intervals, with default statistical significance assumed at p<0.05.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethical approval has been obtained from the Northern Sydney Local Health District's Human Research Ethics Committee (approval ID #2024/ETH00180).<h4>Trial registration number</h4>NCT06180616.",2025,"['insulin', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors', 'hba1c', 'insulin', 'hba1c', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'hba1c']"

Unveiling Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Obesity-Associated Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"<h4>Background</h4>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease primarily affecting women of childbearing age, characterised by relapsing inflammation across multiple organ systems. Its aetiology involves genetic and environmental factors that trigger immune dysregulation, leading to the excessive release of autoantibodies.<h4>Objective</h4>This study discusses the pathogenesis, diagnosis, management and emerging therapeutic targets in SLE, with a focus on metabolic reprogramming and the role of obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings, with the EULAR and ACR criteria being the most advanced. SLE management requires individualised treatment, addressing the severity and organs affected.<h4>Results</h4>SLE presents with symptoms ranging from mild skin rashes to severe conditions like pulmonary hypertension and kidney failure. Advances in care have improved outcomes, with 80%-90% of patients achieving normal life expectancy with proper treatment. Metabolic reprogramming in immune cells is crucial to SLE pathogenesis, as altered glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation contribute to inflammation.<h4>Discussion</h4>Obesity is recognised to aggravate SLE by fostering chronic inflammation, immunological dysregulation and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. These situations may exacerbate autoimmunity, especially in genetically predisposed individuals. It is suggested that obesity significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE, and additional study should investigate metabolic therapy aimed at obesity and microbiota to re-establish immunological equilibrium and mitigate disease development.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Targeting metabolic pathways may offer new therapeutic options for improved disease management. Particular abnormalities in gut microbiota, characterised by reduced diversity and an increase in pro-inflammatory species, influence obesity-related immunological dysregulation in systemic lupus erythematosus and may present new therapeutic targets.",2025,[],[]

Orchestrating Nutrient Homeostasis: RNA-Binding Proteins as Molecular Conductors in Metabolic Disease Pathogenesis.,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of post-transcriptional processes, playing essential roles in nutrient metabolism and metabolic homeostasis. This literature review explores how RBPs influence the metabolism of glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism by controlling processes like mRNA stability and translation regulation. The dysregulation of RBPs, including HuR, PTB, and YTHDF1, is linked to metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Advances in techniques like TREX technology and transcriptome analysis have deepened our understanding of RBP functions. Additionally, RBPs show promise as potential biomarkers and targets for new therapies. Future research directions in RBPs could focus on tissue-specific regulation and nutrient-RBP interactions.

Self-efficacy as a Mediator of the Relationships Between Obesity and Asthma Outcomes in Black and Latino Children.,"<h4>Background</h4>Asthma and obesity are two of the most common pediatric conditions in the USA that are comorbid and exacerbate one another. This study examined whether asthma management self-efficacy-perceived ability to control asthma-mediates the relationship between obesity and asthma outcomes, including pulmonary function, perception of respiratory compromise, and emergency department visits.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 303 children ages 10-17 were recruited from clinics in the Bronx. Participants were on average 13.20 years old (SD = 2.22), 53.8% male, 62.7% Latino, and 47.2% Black. The study consisted of a baseline visit with spirometry testing to assess pulmonary function and questionnaires to evaluate demographics, healthcare utilization, and self-efficacy. Participants were also assigned peak flow monitors to measure perception of respiratory compromise, which were utilized at home twice daily for 4 weeks.<h4>Results</h4>Obesity was associated with worse pulmonary function (β =  - 3.83, p = 0.03). Asthma management self-efficacy was associated with more accurate perception (β = 5.14, p = 0.03). Obesity was not associated with self-efficacy, accurate perception, or emergency department visits. Asthma management self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between obesity and asthma outcomes, nor was it associated with pulmonary function or emergency visits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study confirms the association between obesity and worse pulmonary function in Black and Latino children. The link between higher asthma management self-efficacy and more accurate perception of respiratory compromise independent of obesity status suggests a modifiable target for intervention irrespective of body habitus.",2025,[],[]
Ghrelin and LEAP2: Their Interaction Effect on Appetite Regulation and the Alterations in Their Levels Following Bariatric Surgery.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Ghrelin plays key roles in appetite regulation, involving both homeostatic and hedonic pathways. In obesity, its metabolism is affected by alterations in neural and hormonal responses. Liver-Enriched Antimicrobial Peptide 2 (LEAP2), recently identified as an endogenous ghrelin receptor antagonist, has emerged as a potential regulator of appetite and energy balance, and bariatric surgery is known to induce changes in this system. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the roles of acyl ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, and LEAP2 in food intake regulation and summarize findings on the alterations in their levels after bariatric surgery. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We conducted a narrative review of human and animal studies published in the literature investigating the roles of acyl ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, and LEAP2 in food intake regulation, as well as changes in their levels in obesity and following bariatric surgery. <i>Results</i>: Alterations in the ghrelin system, i.e., the acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin isoforms and LEAP2, in obesity have been reported. Experimental studies have shown that LEAP2 administration reduces food intake and body weight by suppressing ghrelin-induced food intake. Most studies have found marked reductions in fasting acyl ghrelin after sleeve gastrectomy, more so than after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. <i>Conclusions</i>: In obesity, altered neural and hormonal responses to food also affect ghrelin metabolism, with significant deviations in acyl ghrelin levels and impaired appetite regulation mechanisms. Unlike ghrelin, LEAP2 levels tend to be elevated in obesity. While changes in acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin isoforms, particularly after sleeve gastrectomy, are well documented, data on LEAP2 remain limited. Further research is needed to better define the role of LEAP2 in ghrelin-mediated food intake and its potential as a therapeutic target in obesity.",2025,"['ghrelin', 'antimicrobial peptide 2', 'leap2', 'ghrelin receptor', 'acyl ghrelin', 'des - acyl ghrelin', 'leap2', 'acyl ghrelin', 'des - acyl ghrelin', 'leap2', 'ghrelin', 'acyl ghrelin', 'des - acyl ghrelin isoforms', 'leap2', 'leap2', 'ghrelin', 'acyl ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'acyl ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'leap2', 'acyl ghrelin', 'des - acyl ghrelin isoforms', 'leap2', 'leap2', 'ghrelin']","['ghrelin', 'leap2', 'ghrelin receptor']"
"Failure of Hepatic Insulin Clearance via CEACAM1-Mediated Endocytosis: The Missing Physiological Link Between Proinsulin Misfolding, Hyperinsulinemia, and Metabolic Complications in Type 2 Diabetes, Obesity, and NAFLD","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), projected to affect 700 million individuals by 2045, may be driven by a hypothesized physiological axis where impaired hepatic insulin clearance, mediated by CEACAM1 endocytosis, links proinsulin misfolding to chronic hyperinsulinemia, exacerbating T2DM, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Approximately 50–80% of proinsulin, synthesized at ~6000 molecules per second, undergoes 5–10% misfolding due to disrupted disulfide bonds (B7-A7, B19-A20, A6-A11) under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, compounded by glutathione (GSH) depletion, which primarily impairs protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) function critical for insulin synthesis. Hepatic clearance involves CEACAM1 binding, insulin receptor isoform B (IR-B) tyrosine 960 autophosphorylation, AP-2/clathrin/dynamin vesicle formation, Rab5-mediated acidification (pH 5.5), Rab7 trafficking, and lysosomal cathepsin B/D hydrolysis, supported by IR-B–IRS-1 tyrosine 608–PI3K–PDK1–Akt (Ser473)–GSK3β signaling. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR: IRE1α-XBP1, PERK-eIF2α, ATF6), increasing clearance demand. When clearance fails, misfolded proinsulin accumulates, driving hyperinsulinemia, which promotes insulin resistance, activates mTORC1–SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis and VLDL export, and contributes to NAFLD and obesity, as observed in CEACAM1 knockout models. The Hepatic Insulin Clearance Index (HICI), derived from a 50-g glucose challenge yielding a C-peptide/insulin ratio &lt;1, may diagnose impaired clearance with greater sensitivity than HOMA-IR. Emerging tools, such as cryo-EM and portal vein proteomics, could quantify misfolded aggregates and elucidate NAFLD connections. Potential therapeutic strategies, including CEACAM1 enhancers and IR-B agonists, may target this clearance axis. This hypothesis underscores hepatic insulin clearance as a potential mediator of insulin resistance and its role in diseases linked to chronic hyperinsulinemia.",2025,"['insulin', 'ceacam1', '##insulin', 'proinsulin', 'protein disulfide isomerase', 'pdi', 'insulin', 'ceacam1', 'insulin receptor isoform b', 'ir - b', 'ap - 2', 'clathrin', 'dynamin', 'rab5', 'rab7', 'l', '##ys', 'cathepsin b / d', 'ir - b', 'irs - 1', 'p', 'pdk1', 'akt', '##47', 'gsk3β', 'ire1α', 'xbp1', 'perk', 'eif2α', 'atf6', '##insulin', 'insulin', 'mtorc1', 'srebp - 1c', 'vldl', 'ceacam1', 'hepatic insulin', 'c - peptide', 'insulin', 'homa - ir', 'nafld', 'ceacam1 enhancers', 'ir - b', 'insulin', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'ceacam1', 'proinsulin', 'protein disulfide isomerase', 'pdi', 'clathrin', 'dynamin', 'rab5', 'rab7', 'pdk1', 'akt', 'gsk3β', 'ire1alpha', 'xbp1', 'perk', 'eif2alpha', 'atf6', 'mtorc1', 'vldl', 'c peptide', 'nafld']"
Firmicutes in gut microbiota: hormonal influence on breast cancer in obese individuals.,"Breast cancer (BC) is among the leading causes of death in women. The risk factors of BC are various, among which obesity has been proved to be closely related to the incidence and progression of BC, especially in postmenopausal women. Obesity leads to elevated estrogen levels, increased inflammatory factors, and insulin resistance, which are considered to increase the risk of BC. Microbial dysbiosis has emerged as an important element in the development and progression of various cancers, including BC. Meanwhile, Firmicutes, a phylum enriched in the gut microbiota, can affect the metabolism of estrogen and progesterone, which explains part of its role in promoting the development of BC. This review highlights the ""obesity-microbiota-hormone-breast cancer"" axis, focusing on Firmicutes influence on BC in hormone levels. We also explore potential methods to prevent obesity-related BC and improve patient survival outcomes by regulating gut microbiota. To identify relevant studies, we conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 2025 using a combination of MeSH terms and free-text keywords related to obesity, microbiota, hormones, and BC.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']

Current Insights into Obesity and m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A Modification.,"Obesity has emerged as a global health challenge, closely associated with multiple metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The traditional ""calories-in minus calories-out"" paradigm is no longer sufficient to explain the heterogeneity of obesity; consequently, a growing body of research has turned its focus to epigenetic regulation-particularly chemical modifications at the RNA level. <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification is one of the most abundant epigenetic modifications on RNA, which dynamically regulates the methylation reaction in specific sequences on mRNA through methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and binding proteins (readers). Accumulating evidence in recent years has revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of obesity, particularly through its regulation of key biological processes, such as adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis. Given its critical involvement in metabolic dysregulation, targeting m<sup>6</sup>A-related mechanisms may offer novel therapeutic avenues for obesity management. This review systematically summarizes the current understanding of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in obesity, elucidates its underlying molecular mechanisms, and evaluates its potential as a therapeutic target. By integrating recent advances in the field, we aim to provide new perspectives for the development of innovative strategies in obesity treatment.",2025,[],[]
The mediating role of sleep bedtime regularity in the association between neighborhood factors and childhood obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Regular bedtime patterns have been inversely associated with obesity. In turn, safe and supportive neighborhoods positively associate with children's bedtime regularity. We sought to determine whether bedtime regularity mediates between these two neighborhood factors and obesity among US children aged 6-17.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from the 2021-22 National Survey of Children's Health (n = 59,078), two mediation models tested the effect of bedtime regularity on associations between neighborhood factors and obesity. Both models adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, household poverty, physical activity, and caregiver's education. Caregivers reported on neighborhood factors, obesity, and sleep.<h4>Results</h4>Unsafe neighborhoods: In Model 1, living in unsafe neighborhoods associated with irregular bedtime (OR = 1.82 [95 % CI: 1.46, 2.28]). In Model 2, living in unsafe neighborhoods did not significantly associate with obesity (OR = 1.12 [0.89, 1.40]); irregular bedtime significantly associated with obesity (OR = 1.22 [1.07, 1.40]). Bootstrap CIs derived from 1000 samples indicated a significant indirect mediating effect (adjusted β = 0.02 [0.01, 0.022]). Unsupportive neighborhoods: In Model 1, living in unsupported neighborhoods associated with irregular bedtime (OR = 1.58 [1.41, 1.76]). In Model 2, living in unsupported neighborhoods and irregular bedtime significantly associated with obesity (OR = 1.14 [1.03, 1.26] and 1.21 [1.06, 1.39]). Bootstrap CIs indicated a significant indirect mediating effect (adjusted β = 0.01 [0.007, 0.014]).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings highlight the impact of living in disadvantaged neighborhoods and suggest promoting bedtime regularity may be a suitable obesity intervention target for youth living in these settings. Due to the small effect sizes and the cross-sectional design of our study, our findings should be considered along with other established targets.",2025,[],[]
Flavonoid-rich extracts of Nelumbo nucifera leaves alleviate obesity in HFD-fed mice via microbiota-dependent modulation of brown fat thermogenesis.,"<h4>Ethnopharmacological relevance</h4>Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn (lotus) leaf is a commonly used traditional Chinese herbal medicine with a wide range of pharmacological properties, especially lipid-lowering and weight-loss effects. Accumulating evidence highlights activation of the thermogenic program of brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a promising anti-obesity strategy. However, it remains unclear whether such beneficial metabolic effects induced by the lotus leaf are related to its regulatory role in BAT function.<h4>Aim of the study</h4>This work aims to investigate whether the lotus leaf reduces obesity by activating BAT and to elucidate whether the mechanism behind it is related to the regulation of gut microbiota.<h4>Material and methods</h4>A mouse model of obesity was established using a high-fat diet (HFD), and the anti-obesity effect of flavonoid-rich lotus leaf extract (LLE) was determined in vivo. An animal energy metabolism monitoring system confirmed that LLE promoted energy expenditure. Then, RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting were conducted to detect the expression of genes and proteins involved in BAT thermogenesis. Subsequently, the underlying mechanisms were demonstrated by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and non-targeted metabolism analysis. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to investigate the LLE-dependent alleviation of obesity via the gut microbiota-BAT axis.<h4>Results</h4>Our study demonstrated that LLE effectively reduced weight gain, ameliorated glucolipid disorders, and enhanced energy expenditure in HFD-fed mice. Notably, LLE augmented BAT activity by increasing thermogenic markers (e.g., SIRT1, PGC-1α, UCP1) and repressing inflammatory responses, potentially through activation of β<sub>3</sub>-AR/AMPK/p38 signaling pathways. Importantly, LLE could mitigate HFD-induced microbial dysbiosis (decrease in Proteobacteria, Verrucomicbiota, Acidobacteriota, Bacteroides, Dubosiella, and increase in Bilophila, Tyzzerella, Oscillibacter, Akkermansia, and Alistipes) and significantly altered 5 metabolite pathways, especially primary bile acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism. The FMT experiment confirmed that the microbial changes induced by LLE were associated with reduced body weight, enhanced energy expenditure, increased BAT activity, and thermogenesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Collectively, our findings reveal that lotus leaf promotes brown fat thermogenesis by modulating gut microbiota, identifying it as a promising new treatment target for obesity.",2025,"['sirt1', 'pgc - 1α', 'ucp1', 'ampk', 'p38']","['sirt1', 'ucp1', 'ampk', 'p38']"
Mazdutide reduces body weight in adults with overweight or obesity: A high-dose Phase 1 trial.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Mazdutide, an agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptors, significantly reduced weight in early phase trials at doses up to 10 mg. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of mazdutide up to 16 mg in adults with overweight or obesity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Thirty-two adults with overweight/obesity without diabetes received once-weekly subcutaneous injections of mazdutide (n = 24) or placebo (n = 8) for 20 weeks. Two mazdutide dose escalation regimens (Cohorts 1 and 2, n = 12 each) were used to reach a 16-mg target dose. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and mixed model repeated measures to estimate least square means with standard error (SE).<h4>Results</h4>At Week 20, mean percent change from baseline in body weight was -20.0% (SE: 1.9) for Cohort 1 and -21.0% (1.2) for Cohort 2 versus -0.1% (1.5) for placebo (p < 0.001). Weight loss of ≥15% was achieved by 66.7% of Cohort 1 and 75.0% of Cohort 2. No placebo participants achieved ≥5% weight loss. Mean percent change in waist circumference was -12.0% (SE: 1.7) in Cohort 1 and -17.0% (1.7) in Cohort 2 versus -0.8% (2.1) in placebo (p < 0.001). Improved fasting metabolic biomarker profiles and reduced appetite were associated with mazdutide treatment. No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported, and the most common AEs were mild or moderate gastrointestinal disorders.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mazdutide at 16 mg was well tolerated and associated with greater weight loss at higher doses than previously studied and improved metabolic regulation in adults with overweight or obesity.

"Anti-obesity compounds, Semaglutide and LiPR, and PrRP do not change the proportion of human and mouse POMC+ neurons.","Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) have become one of the most prescribed drugs in human medicine. While AOMs are known to impact adult neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, their effects on the functional maturation of hypothalamic neurons remain unexplored. Given that AOMs target neurons in the Medial Basal Hypothalamus (MBH), which play a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis, we hypothesized that AOMs might influence the functional maturation of these neurons, potentially rewiring the MBH. To investigate this, we exposed hypothalamic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to Semaglutide and lipidized prolactin-releasing peptide (LiPR), two anti-obesity compounds. Contrary to our expectations, treatment with Semaglutide or LiPR during neuronal maturation did not affect the proportion of anorexigenic, Pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC+) neurons. Additionally, LiPR did not alter the morphology of POMC+ neurons or the expression of selected genes critical for the metabolism or development of anorexigenic neurons. Furthermore, LiPR did not impact the proportion of adult-generated POMC+ neurons in the mouse MBH. Taken together, these results suggest that AOMs do not influence the functional maturation of anorexigenic hypothalamic neurons.",2025,"['prolactin - releasing peptide', 'lipr', 'lipr', 'pro - opiomelanocortin', 'pomc +', 'lipr', 'pomc +', 'lipr', 'pom']","['prolactin releasing peptide', 'pro opiomelanocortin']"
Dietitians' Adherence and Perspectives on the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) and the European Federation of the Associations of Dietitians (EFAD) Recommendations for Overweight and Obesity Management: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Recent guidelines developed by the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) and the European Federation of the Associations of Dietitians (EFAD) focused on the dietetic management of obesity in adults. The present study aimed to explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals regarding these guidelines.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 85 registered dietitians/nutritionists from Greece, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom completed an online survey, and 10 were interviewed, in February-March 2023. Demographic data were also collected.<h4>Results</h4>Awareness of the EASO-EFAD guidelines among registered dietitians/nutritionists was moderate (57.6%), but only 20% had read them in full. Dietitians with higher education and relevant experience were more likely to have read the guidelines. Less than half reported that key evidence-based recommendations, such as individualized medical nutrition therapy and intensive behavioral interventions, are already included in national guidance. Recommendations like portfolio or DASH diets, partial meal replacements, and calorie restriction were less commonly part of national guidance/usual practice. A small percentage of participants described their adoption of several nutritional approaches novel to them. These included the portfolio dietary pattern, partial meal replacements, and intermittent fasting or continuous calorie restriction. For some Irish dietitians, prioritizing weight as the main outcome conflicted with their emphasis on overall health and individualized nutrition therapy. Other barriers of recommendation implementation included exclusive availability in English, rapid changes in obesity management, staffing shortages, limited multidisciplinary collaboration, and inconsistent knowledge among healthcare providers.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present study identified gaps in the adoption of the EASO-EFAD guidelines into dietetic/clinical practice. EFAD will develop strategies to disseminate these guidelines at different levels of stakeholders (national/local authorities, dietitians/nutritionists, and patients).",2025,[],[]
Coated glucose microbeads stimulate enteric hormone release and improve glucose tolerance in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.,"<h4>Aims</h4>Incretin agonists are used to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Instead of systemically delivering high levels of hormone receptor agonists that can lead to adverse effects, we tested and optimized oral microbead formulations that activate endogenous enteroendocrine signalling systems via distal nutrient-sensing cells.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We report two randomized Phase 1 studies (NCT05713773 and NCT05737927) measuring acute pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic responses following consumption of microbeads that deliver glucose to the distal small intestine: these studies compared coating variations and glucose dosing. The primary endpoint was plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels; we also measured GLP-2, PYY, glicentin, oxyntomodulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, C-peptide, and insulin as exploratory endpoints. In a subsequent randomized Phase 2a trial (NCT05803772), prediabetic subjects consumed a lead formulation or placebo once daily for 6 weeks each in a two-period, two-sequence crossover design. Oral glucose tolerance was measured at baseline and following treatment in each sequence, with the primary endpoint being the change in the area under the curve.<h4>Results</h4>Our microbead formulation successfully targeted the distal small intestine and elicited a robust plurihormonal enteroendocrine response; our Phase 2a data show that the lead formulation improved glucose tolerance in pre-diabetic patients, comparable to results using GLP-1 mimetics. Adverse events were infrequent and modest.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Targeted glucose release activates endogenous enteroendocrine signalling networks, improves a clinically relevant metabolic endpoint, and has minimal adverse effects.

"Genetic insights into visceral obesity with health conditions, from disease susceptibility to therapeutic intervention.","<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to investigate the relationship between visceral obesity and various disease traits, as well as to identify potential safe targets for the prevention and treatment of visceral obesity.<h4>Study design</h4>Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to examine the associations between visceral obesity and 1883 disease traits. Furthermore, we assessed the potential effect of 1684 protein expressions on visceral obesity using the available quantitative trait locus data for plasma proteins. To evaluate the potential safety profiles associated with biomarker intervention, we conducted phenome-wide MR using 1883 outcomes, focusing on the significant biomarkers.<h4>Results</h4>Visceral obesity was significantly associated with elevated risks of 183 disease traits across multiple systems, such as endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary systems. Higher genetically predicted levels of GCKR, CYB5A, ITPKA, and ENTPD6 were found to increase the risk of visceral obesity, while 1433B, SEMA3G, FOXO3, and HAPLN4 were associated with a decreased risk of visceral obesity. The results of the phenome-wide MR analysis indicate that CYB5A, ENTPD6, 1433B, and HAPLN4 can potentially be safe and effective drug targets for visceral obesity treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study indicates visceral obesity is associated with an increased risk of diseases within various physiological systems, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine systems.

Diet quality and obesity in women of reproductive age in Northern Tanzania: a cross-sectional study,"<h4>Background</h4>  Obesity is an increasing problem among women of reproductive age (WRA) in Tanzania. <h4>Objective</h4>  We described WRA’s nutritional status by socio-demographic factors and assessed associations with diet quality. <h4>Methods</h4>  We analysed baseline data from a cluster-randomised controlled trial in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions (n=2,415). Diet was assessed using a quantitative 24-hour recall. We calculated the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS; 0-49), with higher scores indicating healthier diet. General obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m 2 ; morbid obesity as BMI≥35 kg/m 2 ; ; and central obesity as: waist circumference (WC)≥80 cm, WC≥88 cm, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)≥0.85, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)≥0.50, and WHR≥0.85 or BMI≥30 kg/m 2 . We tested associations between diet quality and nutritional status using generalised linear models controlling for age and sociodemographic factors and tested interactions to assess differential associations by age groups. <h4>Results</h4>  The prevalence of general obesity was 25.1%, morbid obesity 8.4%, and central obesity 48.2-71.6% depending on the definition. Mean GDQS was 20.9±3.9. General and central obesity were more prevalent among women who were older, less educated, had light physical labour occupations, were in the highest wealth quintile, and lived in more urbanised villages and in more food secure households. Higher GDQS was associated with lower risk of morbid obesity: risk ratio (RR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.94, 1.00). Higher GDQS was also associated with 0.25-0.27 kg/m 2 lower BMI, 0.54-0.66 cm lower WC, and 0.53-0.58 cm lower hip circumference in women 30-49 years of age. <h4>Conclusion</h4>  Better diet quality emerged as a protective factor for morbid obesity and for other obesity measures among women 30-49 years of age. Our study suggests that interventions to improve diet quality in Tanzania should target women in their thirties and forties and those with lower physical activity and higher education, food security, and wealth to maximise effectiveness. <h4>Keywords: </h4> obesity, overweight, BMI, Tanzania, women of reproductive age, low- and middle-income countries",2025,[],[]
Adipose Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicle MicroRNAs: Diagnostic Biomarkers for the Pathophysiology Associated with Obesity.,"Obesity is a global health problem that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, fatty liver disease, and cancer. The pathological outcomes of obesity and the responses to weight loss interventions vary significantly among individuals. The use of noninvasive biomarkers is critical for the early risk prediction of diseases associated with obesity and monitoring disease progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play pivotal roles in biological processes of adipose development, inflammation, and function. Dysregulation of numerous miRNAs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and associated diseases. In addition to exerting their function in the cytoplasm, mature miRNAs can be packaged into vesicles, released into extracellular space and body fluids, and act as paracrine and endocrine factors mediating intercellular and interorgan crosstalk. Encapsulation of miRNAs in extracellular vesicles (EVs) protects them from degradation and enhances their stability in body fluids. Moreover, the unique EV-miRNA signature reflects the state of the origin cells and is functionally related to disease pathology, supporting their potential as sensitive and specific biomarkers for clinical diagnostics. Adipose tissue is the main source of circulating EV-miRNAs in Obesity. Here we highlight the implication of adipose tissue-derived EV-miRNAs in metabolic disorders associated with obesity. Current understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the sorting of miRNAs into EVs and recent advancements in relevant techniques are reviewed. In addition, limitations and future perspectives in this field are discussed.",2025,[],[]

Tanycytic ciliary calcium links metabolic sensing to appetite control,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>The central nervous system maintains energy balance by sensing the body’s metabolic state1,2, yet the precise cellular and molecular sensors involved remain elusive. Tanycytes, specialized glial cells lining the hypothalamic third ventricle, are strategically positioned to monitor systemic signals3-7, and their primary cilia — antenna-like organelles — are implicated in this process8 . However, whether and how these cilia translate metabolic information into a behavioral response is unknown. Here we show that tanycyte primary cilia are dynamic metabolic sensors whose length is remodeled by physiological and pathological states, such as fasting and obesity. Genetic ablation of these cilia in tanycytes exacerbates diet-induced obesity by impairing homeostatic control. Mechanistically, we uncover a two-stage, ciliary-to-cytoplasmic calcium relay: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling triggers a localized Ca²⁺ influx through the ciliary channel TRPC3, which serves as a spark to ignite a global calcium wave amplified by release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This signal governs tanycyte activity, which in turn gates a key hypothalamic anorexigenic circuit to suppress feeding. These findings identify a fundamental sensory mechanism that couples glial cells to neural circuits, establishing the tanycytic cilium as a critical regulator of appetite and a potential therapeutic target for obesity.</p>",2025,"['sonic hedgehog', 'shh', 'trpc3']","['shh', 'trpc3']"
"Obesity and food marketing: a narrative review of consumer influence, regulatory gaps, and ethical implications.","<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a multifactorial global health crisis exacerbated by modern food marketing strategies that encourage the consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods. Children and socio-economically disadvantages groups are particularly vulnerable to the cognitive and emotional cues embedded in food advertising.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the ethical aspects of marketing to vulnerable groups, evaluate the shortcomings of the current regulatory frameworks, critically analyze the impact of food marketing on consumer behavior and dietary patterns, and offer policy-relevant insights for public health interventions. Methods: Multidisciplinary sources from the fields of public health, behavioral psychology, marketing science, and nutrition policy were synthesized through an extensive narrative review. Through methodical searches of databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, peer-reviewed and gray literature were found. Among the theoretical models used are the REFCAM model, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the Social Cognitive Theory.<h4>Results</h4>Food marketing uses digital microtargeting, sensory cues, and psychological priming to influence consumption. Overconsumption has become commonplace due to strategies including portion control, manipulating brand loyalty, and health halo benefits. Despite global variation in regulatory responses, corporate lobbying, disjointed governance, and inadequate digital oversight often limit their effectiveness. Marketing aimed at minorities and children raises ethical concerns, as there is proof of exploitation through deceptive and culturally specific advertising. Comparative case studies highlight regulatory achievements (like Chile and France) as well as failures (like UK policy delays).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Food marketing is a major contributor to the development of obesogenic environments, despite being poorly controlled. A change from reactive to proactive, system-level governance is necessary to combat obesity. Strong digital control, more stringent nutrient profiling, and a moral shift in food marketing strategies are all part of this.

While 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), a bioactive flavone derived from <i>Kaempferia parviflora</i>, has demonstrated anti-obesity and muscle-preserving properties, its effects on sarcopenic obesity remain unclear. <b>Methods</b>: Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks to induce sarcopenic obesity, followed by 8 weeks of continued HFD with the oral administration of DMF. Muscle function was assessed through grip strength and treadmill running tests, while muscle and fat volumes were measured using micro-CT. Mechanistic analyses were performed using gene expression and Western blot analysis. <b>Results</b>: DMF significantly reduced body weight, fat mass, and adipocyte size while enhancing grip strength, endurance, skeletal muscle mass, and the muscle fiber cross-sectional area. In the gastrocnemius muscle, DMF increased the gene expression of <i>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α</i> (<i>Ppargc1a</i>) and its isoform <i>Ppargc1a4</i>, thereby promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. It also improved protein turnover by modulating protein synthesis and degradation via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway. In subcutaneous and brown adipose tissues, DMF increased mitochondrial DNA content and the expression of thermogenic and beige adipocyte-related genes. These findings suggest that DMF alleviates sarcopenic obesity by improving mitochondrial function and regulating energy metabolism in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissues via PGC-1α-mediated pathways. Thus, DMF represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the integrated management of sarcopenic obesity.",2025,"['d', 'peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator - 1α', 'ppargc1a', 'ppargc1a4', 'phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase', 'protein kinase b', 'd', 'p', '##gc - 1α', 'dmf']","['ppargc1a', 'phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase', 'protein kinase b', 'dmf']"
Insights Into the Management of Type 2 Diabetes at Diagnosis in Spain: The NEW2TYPE2 Study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study analysed the opinions and perceptions of Spanish physicians towards the management of people newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) aged ≤ 65 years.<h4>Methods</h4>Online survey targeting primary care physicians (PCPs) and endocrinologists (members of three national scientific societies) treating people with T2D. Management practices and factors determining prescribed therapies and treatment goals were captured in general and by patient profile. The respondents' perception of the limitations in setting strict glycaemic control objectives and weight loss targets, and the feasibility and impact of possible solutions, were examined.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 105 physicians (60% PCPs, 40% endocrinologists) responded to the survey; 98% of respondents reported following clinical practice guidelines; 53.3% and 27.6% considered stringent glycaemic control to be HbA1c levels of 6.0%-6.5% and 6.5%-7.0%, respectively. In patient profiles with overweight/obesity, > 90% reported setting weight loss goals, with 5%-10% weight loss being the most common target. The most limiting factors for the establishment of stringent glycaemic and weight loss targets were the lack of awareness of self-care of the disease (74.3%) and the cost to the healthcare system of the most effective drugs (72.4%). Training and the implementation of simple protocols and algorithms were the solutions perceived as having the greatest impact and feasibility. Redefining visa criteria was considered the solution with the highest impact.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results are consistent with clinical practice guidelines' recommendations in Spain, but early and intensive interventions focused on reducing the risk of long-term complications in people with T2D who have longer life expectancy could be promoted at diagnosis.",2025,['hba1c'],['hba1c']
Myeloid-specific CAMKK2 deficiency protects against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by rewiring metabolic gene expression and enhancing energy expenditure.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Obesity is associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation in metabolic tissues such as liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle implicating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes as inflammatory diseases. This inflammatory response involves the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in these metabolically relevant organs. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-2 (CAMKK2) is a key regulator of cellular and systemic energy metabolism, and a coordinator of macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses. However, its role in obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction is not fully defined. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of CAMKK2 to the regulation of inflammation and systemic metabolism during diet-induced obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Camkk2 were generated and challenged with a high-fat diet. Metabolic phenotyping, histological analyses, and transcriptomic profiling were used to assess whole-body metabolism, liver lipid accumulation, and gene expression in macrophages and adipose tissue.<h4>Results</h4>Myeloid-specific Camkk2 deficiency protected mice from high fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance and liver steatosis. These protective effects were associated with rewiring of metabolic and inflammatory gene expression in both macrophages and adipose tissue, along with enhanced whole-body energy expenditure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data establish CAMKK2 as an important regulator of macrophage function and putative therapeutic target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.",2025,"['insulin', 'ca <', '> 2 + < / su', '> - calmodulin - dependent protein kinase kinase - 2', 'camkk2', 'camkk2', 'camkk2', 'camkk2', 'insulin', 'camkk2']","['insulin', 'camkk2']"
Time-restricted eating and its metabolic benefits in obesity and insulin resistance.,"<h4>Background & aims</h4>This study aimed to critically review the potential effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) on lipemic and glycemic control, as well as certain inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, in individuals with obesity and insulin resistance.<h4>Methods</h4>A critical review of the relevant published articles (56 original articles) from 2007 to 2025 was carried out using several search engines, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The following keywords were used: TRE, insulin resistance, inflammatory biomarkers, and blood glucose.<h4>Results</h4>TRE shows potential in improving glycemic and lipemic control in obese individuals with insulin resistance, although its effect on inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 remains inconsistent. Mechanistic studies suggest that activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ketosis help enhance glucose metabolism, promote autophagy, boost mitochondrial function, and lower triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Despite these benefits, human trial results are mixed, with inconsistencies mainly caused by small sample sizes, varying TRE protocols, and differences in study design and populations characteristics.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The effect of TRE is contradictory regarding body weight, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and pro-inflammatory status. Furthermore, a well-designed, randomized controlled trial with a long study duration is warranted to investigate the effectiveness of TRE, as it would provide critical insights into the sustainability and broader health impact of this dietary approach.",2025,"['interleukin - 1 beta', 'il - 1β', 'tumor necrosis factor - alpha', 't', '##nf - α', 'interleukin - 6', 'il - 6', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'il - 1β', 'tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase', 'am', '##pk', 'ma', '##mmalian target of rapam', 'mtor', 'low - density lipoprotein', 'ldl', 'insulin']","['interleukin 1 beta', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'interleukin 6', 'insulin', 'mtor', 'low density lipoprotein', 'ldl']"
Identification of potential crucial genes and mechanisms associated with metabolically unhealthy obesity based on the gene expression profile.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is an epidemic and systemic metabolic disease that seriously endangers human health. This study aimed to understand the transcriptomic characteristics of the blood of metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) and provide insight into the target genes of differently expressed microRNAs in the occurrence and development of MUO.<h4>Methods</h4>The GSE146869, GSE145412, GSE23561, and GSE169290 datasets were analyzed to understand the transcriptome characteristics of the blood of MUO and provide insights into the target genes of differently expressed microRNAs (DEMs) in MUO. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses and gene interaction network analyses were performed to profile the function of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition, miRNet 2.0, TransmiR v2.0, RNA22, TargetScan 7.2, miRDB, and miRWalk databases were used to predict the target genes of effective microRNAs.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 189 co-DEGs were identified in at least two datasets. The 156 co-upregulated genes were enriched into 29 biological process (BP) terms and 12 KEGG pathways. Among the 29 BP terms, the immune- and metabolism-related BP terms were enriched. The 33 co-downregulated genes were enriched into two BP terms, including apoptotic process and regulation of the apoptotic process, with no KEGG pathway. The hub genes <i>EGF</i>, <i>STAT3</i>, <i>IL1B</i>, <i>PF4</i>, <i>SELP</i>, and <i>ITGA2B</i> in the gene interaction network might play important roles in abnormal BP in MUO. Among the 19 DEMs identified in the blood of the MUO group by the GSE169290 dataset, 18 microRNAs targeted 85 genes as risk factors in MUO.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A network consisting of 18 microRNAs and 85 target genes might serve as a risk factor for metabolically unhealthy obesity.",2025,"['r', 'egf', 'stat3', 'il1b', 'pf', 'se', 'itga2b']","['egf', 'stat3', 'il1b', 'itga2b']"
Epigenetic Programming of Estrogen Receptor in Adipocytes by High Fat Diet Regulates Obesity-Induced Inflammation.,"Adipose inflammation plays a key role in obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities. Epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, is a molecular link between environmental factors and complex diseases. Here we found that high fat diet (HFD) feeding induced a dynamic change of DNA methylome in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) analyzed by reduced representative bisulfite sequencing. Interestingly, DNA methylation at the promoter of estrogen receptor α (Esr1) was significantly increased by HFD, concomitant with a down-regulation of Esr1 expression. HFD feeding in mice increased the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Dnmt3a, and binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3a to Esr1 promoter in WAT. Mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt1 deficiency displayed increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity upon HFD challenge; while mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt3a deficiency showed a mild metabolic phenotype. Using a modified CRISPR/RNA-guided system to specifically target DNA methylation at the Esr1 promoter in WAT, we found that reducing DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-challenged mice. Our study demonstrated that DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter played an important role in regulating adipose inflammation, which may contribute to obesity-induced insulin resistance.",2025,"['estrogen receptor α', 'esr1', 'esr1', 'dna methyltransferase 1', 'dnmt1', 'dnmt3a', 'dnmt1', 'dnmt3a', 'esr1 promoter', 'd', '##nmt1', 'esr1', 'insulin', 'dnmt3a', 'esr1 promoter', 'esr1 promoter', 'esr1', 'insulin', 'esr1 promoter', 'insulin']","['estrogen receptor alpha', 'esr1', 'dna methyltransferase 1', 'dnmt1', 'dnmt3a', 'insulin']"

Obesity and gastrointestinal cancer: A converging epidemic with surgical consequence.,"Obesity is now a recognised carcinogen with growing implications for gastrointestinal surgical oncology. Excess adiposity promotes tumourigenesis through endocrine, inflammatory, and mechanical pathways, contributing to increased cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and worse oncological outcomes. For patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery, obesity adds significant technical complexity and elevates perioperative morbidity. While effective interventions such as bariatric surgery and GLP-1 receptor agonists now exist, their integration into cancer care remains limited. Emerging evidence suggests potential oncological benefit, but high-quality data on perioperative implementation and impact on treatment response are scarce. Randomised trials evaluating short-course pharmacological strategies during neoadjuvant pathways are urgently needed. In the interim, routine preoperative obesity screening and referral for structured weight loss should be embedded into multidisciplinary workflows. This perspective underscores the importance of recognising and addressing obesity not only as a comorbidity, but as a modifiable risk factor and therapeutic target across the cancer continuum.",2025,['glp - 1 receptor'],['glp 1 receptor']
Cobenefits for Participants of a Nurse-Led Telephone-Based Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Intervention: A Multimethod Qualitative Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>While preventive health behaviour change interventions target specific behaviours and health-related outcomes, there can be further benefits, that is, cobenefits, for participants. Healthy Beginnings is an established behavioural intervention targeting mothers of young children to promote optimal child nutrition, physical activity and screen time behaviours and to prevent obesity in early childhood.<h4>Objective</h4>To (1) identify the cobenefits among mothers and children participating in the one-to-one telephone support arm of the intervention and (2) explore the factors contributing to these identified cobenefits, both from the perspective of the intervention providers, the Child and Family Health Nurses.<h4>Methods</h4>The telephone-based Healthy Beginnings intervention was conducted as a randomised controlled trial in NSW, Australia from 2017 to 2019. The intervention, delivered by Child and Family Health Nurses, included nine staged intervention telephone calls from pregnancy to child age 24 months. The nurses' notes from all telephone calls were collated and analysed using content analysis to identify cobenefits. A focus group was conducted with four intervention nurses and analysed using thematic analysis to explore their experiences of delivering the calls and their perceptions of factors that enabled intervention cobenefits for participants.<h4>Results</h4>From the content analysis of the call notes, we derived categories for the types of issues, beyond the target behaviours, for which participants received support. This support primarily pertained to psychosocial and situational factors, for example, relationship challenges. From the thematic analysis of the focus group, we identified two main themes relating to factors that enabled intervention cobenefits for participants: (a) delivery features, relating to the way the intervention was structured and (b) nurse interactions, relating to the way nurses interacted with participants and approached care holistically. The nurses, via the nurse-initiated staged telephone calls, connected with participants, built rapport, offered tailored child-parent-centred support and addressed social determinants of health.<h4>Discussion</h4>Scheduled nurse telephone support was crucial for delivering tailored intervention messages for targeted behaviour changes and achieving further cobenefits for participants. Nurse-led early childhood interventions for optimal nutrition, sleep and movement behaviours have the potential to support families' broader social contextual factors for greater impacts. Behavioural intervention research must capture and consider a broader concept of participant benefits.",2025,[],[]
The Adipokine Hypothesis of Heart Failure With a Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Novel Framework to Explain Pathogenesis and Guide Treatment.,"<h4>Hypothesis</h4>The paper proposes a novel unifying hypothesis-that heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) arises primarily from the expansion and dysfunctional transformation of visceral adipose tissue, leading to the secretion of altered suite of signaling molecules (adipokines), which causes systemic inflammation, plasma volume expansion, and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.<h4>Elements of the framework</h4>The framework groups adipokines into 3 domains. Domain I adipokines are cardioprotective molecules but are suppressed in patients with excess adiposity. Domain II adipokines are cardioprotective molecules that are up-regulated by adiposity as a compensatory response mechanism. Domain III adipokines, whose secretion is heightened in adiposity, have proinflammatory, prohypertrophic, profibrotic, and antinatriuretic effects. HFpEF results from an adiposity-driven imbalance that promotes Domain III adipokines but suppresses Domain I adipokines, with Domain II adipokines representing an inadequate counter-regulatory response.<h4>Key lines of evidence</h4>1) Obesity and dietary nutrient excess are the major drivers of experimental HFpEF; 2) changes in visceral adiposity and circulating adipokines are observed years before and predict the diagnosis of HFpEF (but not heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction) in the general community; 3) central obesity or visceral adiposity is present in >95% of patients with HFpEF and tracks with disease severity; 4) obesity and HFpEF exhibit striking parallelism in their molecular, pathophysiological, and clinical features; 5) characteristic changes in the adipokine profile occur in parallel in central obesity and heart failure and are correlated with disease severity; 6) adipokines have established effects on cardiac structure and function that can lead to HFpEF; 7) bariatric surgery or drug treatments for HFpEF cause shrinkage of visceral fat depots (disproportionate to changes in body weight), while simultaneously increasing Domain I adipokines and decreasing Domain III adipokines; 8) excess adiposity appears to identify patients most likely to respond to current treatments for HFpEF; and 9) experimental interventions that target only adipose tissue to selectively increase or decrease its secretion of specific adipokines cause distant effects on the heart to modulate cardiac structure and the evolution of cardiomyopathy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The totality of evidence suggests that HFpEF evolves-not as a heterogenous disorder related to diverse comorbidities and not as a primary disorder of cardiomyocytes-but as an adipose-driven derangement that is disseminated (through endocrine-paracrine signaling) to the heart.",2025,"['domain iii adipokines', '##f']",[]
Total intravenous-opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia (OFAA) for a morbid obese patient with a body mass index of 99 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; undergoing gastric bypass: a case report.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bariatric surgery has been established as an effective intervention for weight reduction and the improvement of comorbidities. In this context, the use of opioid-free anesthesia with multimodal analgesia is gaining importance because of its ability to minimize respiratory complications and other opioid-related adverse effects in these patients. In the reviewed literature we found no reports of the use of opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia with total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol/lidocaine/ketamine/dexmedetomidine in bariatric surgery for patients with morbid obesity with a body mass index greater than 60 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<h4>Case presentation</h4>The anesthetic management of a 50-year-old white-Hispanic female patient was documented. The patient suffered from morbid obesity with weight 260 kg, height 1.62 m, and a body mass index of 99 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. She was American Society of Anesthesiologists III with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure.The patient was scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass. Opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia was performed via total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol and standard multimodal analgesia. Low-dose infusions of lidocaine, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine were continued for 48 hours. The patient had a good level of satisfaction during the postoperative period, without the need for postoperative rescue opioids. There was effective pain control (VAS < 3) and an absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. No respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastric complications were observed during the hospital stay, and she was discharged on the eleventh postoperative day, indicating a high level of satisfaction without complications or adverse effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This case shows that opioid-free anesthesia/analgesia can be feasible and safe. The mandatory use of anesthetic depth monitoring together with the validation of target-control infusion models for propofol in obese patients are both recommended to facilitate the more frequent use of total intravenous anesthesia-target-control infusion in this population.",2025,[],[]
Multi-omics of human obesity and related multi-system diseases.,"<h4>Context</h4>Efforts to characterize the shared molecular risk factors that contribute to obesity and the downstream disease sequelae it triggers have been limited.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to identify functional genes with evidence for both causal and consequential effects on obesity related traits and their downstream sequalae using integrated genomic and proteomic data.<h4>Methods</h4>We investigated the association of obesity related traits with 2,912 plasma proteins in 259 individuals from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) with validation of results in ∼45,000 participants from UK Biobank (UKBB). Through colocalization and Mendelian Randomization, we assessed evidence for the shared underpinning and the causal direction of significant proteins with respect to obesity and obesity-associated illnesses. We used gene ontology and cell- and tissue-specific protein and transcriptional activity patterns of the genes encoding target proteins to illuminate the functional relevance of implicated pathways. We additionally investigated the suitability of target proteins as potential therapeutic targets for drug development.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 122 significantly associated with obesity metrics at a false discovery adjusted level (FDR<0.05), 121 replicated in UKBB. Most function in adipogenesis, inflammation, glucose metabolism, and neural and appetite regulation. Eighty of 121 replicated proteins showed evidence of statistical causality for obesity or obesity-associated illnesses. Causally linked showed elevated transcript abundance in adipose and brain tissues and adipocytes. The promising weight reduction potential of several target proteins highlights their suitability for future pharmaceutical repurposing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our analyses revealed key regulatory mechanisms influenced by and influencing obesity, offering valuable targets for biomarkers and clinical interventions.",2025,[],[]
Time Trends of Body Mass Index and its Impact on Glycemic Control Among Finnish Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity prevalence has increased in Finland and is prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Also, hyperglycemia in patients with T2D is partially attributed to obesity. We aimed to examine the time trends of body mass index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control across different BMI categories among Finnish patients with T2D.<h4>Methods</h4>Regional data on the electronic health records (EHRs) covering all public healthcare services in North Karelia, Finland, were used to conduct this retrospective study. Annual patients with T2D from 2012 to 2022 were identified from the EHRs. In each study year, patients with ≥ 1 measurement of BMI and HbA1c were included. Linear and logistic regression analyses estimated with generalized estimating equations were performed to evaluate the time trends.<h4>Results</h4>The annual number of patients for analyses ranged from 5149 to 10,216 during 2012-2022. The unadjusted mean BMI declined slightly over time but increased after age adjustment (all p < 0.05). In the age-stratified analysis adjusted for sex and diabetes duration, mean BMI increased over time in patients aged 45-64 years (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, the increasing time trend in age-adjusted BMI among the study patients persisted after adjusting for sex, diabetes duration, and antidiabetic medication use (p < 0.05). Overall, patients in the higher BMI categories had higher HbA1c levels and were less likely to achieve the HbA1c target from 2012 to 2022. When examining time trends of HbA1c control, HbA1c control improved over time in patients with the highest level of BMI, coinciding with a greater increase in new antidiabetic medication use compared with the lowest BMI group (p < 0.05 for calendar year × obesity class III interaction).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings suggest that weight management requires increased attention among Finnish patients with T2D and is especially important for better glycemic control.",2025,"['g', '##cated hemoglobin', 'hba1c', 'h', 'hba1c', 'hba1c', 'hba1c', 'hba1c']",['hba1c']
Polygenic risk scores of fasting insulin and insulin-related traits in a Taiwanese Han population.,"<h4>Background</h4>Insulin regulates blood sugar levels and several physiological processes, but many aspects of the relationship between insulin regulation and genes still require further discussion. Thus, this study aimed to explore the genetic variations associated with changes in fasting insulin level in Taiwanese Han individuals through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Through GWAS in the primary group and replication in the Follow-up group, no genome-wide significant loci were identified; however, three genes or SNPs, PIP4K2A, FTO, and rs3846601, approached significance. Among them, PIP4K2A and rs3846601 represent novel prominent fasting insulin susceptibility loci identified in this study. Consistency was noted among the target, validation, and Follow-up groups by PRS analysis. Significant associations were observed between fasting insulin level-derived PRS and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and BMI susceptibility. Strong and positive associations traits were found between various diseases/traits in PheWAS, they were morbid obesity, T2D, polycystic ovaries, chronic nonalcoholic liver disease, and hypertension.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified fasting insulin-related loci and developed a PRS model, offering insights into genetic regulation and potential early risk assessment for metabolic diseases in Taiwanese Han population.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'pip4k2a', 'ft', 'pip4k2a', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'pip4k2a']"
"Evolution of multidisciplinary obesity treatments: past, present, and future role of nutrition.","Obesity is a complex chronic disease requiring lifelong comprehensive treatment. In addition to lifestyle counseling that improves nutrition and physical activity, a promising new generation of obesity medications has been added to bariatric procedures as therapeutic options to achieve weight reduction and improve health outcomes. With the promise of effective and safe treatments comes the need to emphasize maximal reduction of body fat and minimal loss of vital body components, including skeletal muscle and bone. Nutrition is a critical aspect of obesity care and is leveraged to support preservation of lean tissues, such as skeletal muscle, through adequate, daily, high-quality protein intake and intake of key micronutrients. More targeted nutrition approaches that promote muscle protein synthesis include amino acid supplementation with leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate. Another potential target for support is the gut microbiome, as its adequate function is increasingly seen as playing a role in human health and metabolism. Obesity is a heterogenous disease, and there is considerable interest in specific metabolic phenotypes that might be used to tailor nutrition strategies. As research advances on these and other fronts, there is the potential to identify precision nutrition strategies for individualized, more effective approaches to lifelong obesity management.",2025,[],[]
Satiety Does Not Silence Food Attention: BMI Modulates Attentional Bias Toward High-Calorie Cues,"<h4>Background</h4>  Attentional bias (AB) for palatable foods has been linked to overeating, yet data on its modulation with body-mass index (BMI) and hunger/satiety are inconsistent. We tested whether hunger, sensory-specific satiety and BMI interact to shape automatic capture of attention by real high-calorie snack foods. <h4>Methods</h4>  Two emotional-attentional-blink (EAB) experiments presented food distractors either 300 msec (lag-3) or 900 msec (lag-9) before a neutral target. Experiment 1 (N = 183; whole BMI range) randomly assigned participants to taste (non-satiated), satiated or non-eating conditions; the snacks eaten (or not eaten) subsequently re-appeared as distractors in the EAB task. Experiment 2 (N = 61; 31 overweight/obese, 30 normal-weight) manipulated hunger/satiety states and snack type (consumed vs. novel) orthogonally, in a double session design. <h4>Results</h4>  Experiment 1— food images presented at lag-3 reduced target detection compared with lag-9 (OR = 0.61, CI 0.50–0.75, p <.01. Higher BMI predicted a larger AB when hungry, but a smaller AB when satiated (OR = 0.65, CI 0.48–0.88, p < 0.01). Experiment 2— For novel snacks, an interaction revealed that participants with overweight/obesity retained robust AB after satiation, whereas AB declined for participants with normal-weight (OR = 2.45, CI 1.09–5.51, p = 0.03). For snacks just eaten, AB remained significant in both groups (lag-3 vs. lag-9: OR = 0.37, CI 0.25–0.55, p <.001). <h4>Conclusions</h4>  Real-food cues automatically biased attention regardless of metabolic state, with BMI modulating this effect: even when satiated, individuals with overweight/obesity continue to orient their attention toward both familiar and novel high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that satiety signals alone may be insufficient to curb attentional capture by food in obesity, highlighting the need for interventions that target attentional control and limit food availability.",2025,[],[]
Hsp47 drives obesity-associated breast cancer progression by enhancing asporin deposition in adipose tissue.,"Fibrosis is an important feature of adipose tissue in obese individuals; nevertheless, roles of obesity-associated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in breast cancer progression largely remain elusive. Here, we show that expression of Hsp47, a chaperone protein involving collagen secretion, is induced in adipose tissue from obese humans and mice. Adipocyte-specific Hsp47 deletion (Adi-KO) suppresses the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and mammary tumor progression, accompanied by a reduction in ECM deposition. Matrisome analyses lead to the identification of asporin as a new target of Hsp47 in adipose tissue. Co-immunoprecipitation results confirm that the recruitment of Hsp47 enhances asporin secretion in adipocytes. We further show that knockout of asporin suppresses HFD-induced mammary tumor growth, while exogenous of asporin partially rescues tumor growth in the decellularized mammary gland derived from Hsp47 Adi-KO mice. These results indicate that asporin at least partially mediates Hsp47 function in HFD-associated tumor progression. Digital spatial profiling (DSP) analyses show that Hsp47 depletion significantly increases the accumulation of CD8 T cells in tumor and tumor-associated adipose tissues. These results implicate that Hsp47, along with-it mediated ECM deposition, suppresses the anti-tumor immunity under HFD conditions. These findings reveal Hsp47 as a novel target for mitigating obesity-associated breast cancer progression.",2025,"['hsp47', 'collagen', 'hsp47', 'ec', 'asporin', 'hsp47', 'hsp47', 'asporin', 'asporin', 'asporin', 'hsp47', 'asporin', 'hsp47', 'hsp47', 'c', '##d8', 'hsp47', 'hsp47']","['hsp47', 'collagen', 'asporin']"
Obesity Control and Cancer Prevention in China: Insights from the Weight Management Year.,"Obesity has emerged as a critical public health challenge worldwide and in China, substantially contributing to the burden of chronic diseases, including cancer. In response, China launched the ""Weight Management Year"" initiative in 2024, representing a strategic shift toward upstream interventions in chronic disease control. This perspective examines the essential role of obesity control in cancer prevention across the complete prevention continuum - primordial (zero-level), primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. The initiative presents a unique opportunity to integrate weight management strategies into health promotion, early risk identification, screening programs, and post-diagnosis rehabilitation. It emphasizes incorporating obesity-related cancer prevention into routine healthcare through digital platforms, multidisciplinary collaboration, and population-wide education campaigns. However, significant challenges persist, including limited public awareness of obesity's carcinogenic risks, insufficient integration between clinical and public health systems, and inadequate multi-sectoral cooperation. Moving forward, cancer prevention in China must transition from a reactive, screening-focused model to a proactive, life-course approach centered on behavioral and lifestyle interventions. Strengthening risk communication, institutionalizing weight management across all prevention levels, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration are essential for building a sustainable, population-wide cancer prevention framework.",2025,[],[]
Intussusception at the jejunojejunal anastomosis five years after RYGB: A case report.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Morbid obesity is a chronic disease with increasing global prevalence. Bariatric surgery is considered the most effective therapy for treating this condition. Like all surgical interventions, bariatric surgery carries certain complications. One of the rare complications is bowel intussusception following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).<h4>Case presentation</h4>A 46-year-old woman initially underwent sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. Six years later, she was converted to RYGB due to gastroesophageal reflux disease. Five years after the conversion, she presented with recurrent abdominal pain. Investigations revealed intussusception at the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. The patient underwent surgical revision of the jejuno-jejunostomy.<h4>Discussion</h4>RYGB is one of the most common bariatric procedures. While it is highly effective for weight loss and improvement of comorbidities, it is associated with certain early and late complications, including the rare occurrence of intussusception. The underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, and the optimal surgical management is still debated. However, revision of the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis appears to offer the lowest recurrence rate.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Intussusception after RYGB is a rare but serious complication that requires timely diagnosis and intervention.

We investigated the association of weight status with glycemic control, diabetes related complications and anti-hyperglycemic medication use among adults living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).<h4>Methods</h4>We analysed data from the 2015 to 2022 cross-sectional Australian National Diabetes Audits (ANDA) to explore the association of weight status with glycemic control and diabetes complications.<h4>Results</h4>13,589 adult patients with T2DM (55.7 % male, mean body mass index 33.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were included. 71 % of patients had above-target glycemia (HbA1c > 7 %). Odds of being moderately above target (HbA1c 7.1-9 %) or greatly above target (HbA1c > 9 %) were higher in patients with obesity (OR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.05, 1.37 and OR 1.43 95 % CI 1.22, 1.68 respectively). Patients with obesity were more likely to have cardiovascular disease, diabetic foot ulcers and peripheral vascular disease, despite use of a greater number of anti-hyperglycemic drugs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with T2DM and obesity have poorer glycemic control, higher utilisation of anti-glycemic medications and greater odds of diabetes related complications. Approaches to optimise glycemic control that also deliver weight reduction should be an integral component of diabetes management to help improve health outcomes for people with T2DM.",2025,"['h', 'hba1', 'hba1']",['hba1']

Risk factors analysis and prediction models of obesity in college students based on dietary patterns.,"<h4>Background</h4>Overweight and obesity among college students have become significant public health concerns. This study aims to develop a nomogram model for assessing obesity risk in college students.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted among college students in Xuzhou. Demographic, dietary, and lifestyle information was obtained through self-administered questionnaires, while body composition was assessed using the InBody 570 analyzer. Dietary patterns and obesity prevalence were examined through multiple indicators. Principal component analysis (PCA), logistic regression, and a non-invasive risk assessment model based on percentage of body fat (PBF) were applied.<h4>Results</h4>The vegetable meat grain dietary pattern and milk egg dietary pattern were associated with a reduced risk of PBF (<i>P</i> < 0.01), while the snack mode dietary pattern and aquatic meat dietary pattern increased the risk of PBF (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Binary logistic regression identified gender, physical activity, late-night snacking, regular meals, and a healthy diet as key predictors of PBF obesity in college students. The model achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.805, with a non-significant Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the model outperformed extreme curves, indicating its reliability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study highlights the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among college students and the importance of using multiple indicators for comprehensive evaluation. The developed PBF-based nomogram model demonstrates potential for obesity screening but requires further validation in diverse populations.",2025,[],[]

"Hijacked Brain in Modern Obesity: Cue, Habit, Addiction, Emotion, and Restraint as Targets for Personalized Digital Therapy and Electroceuticals.","The global obesity epidemic can no longer be explained by personal choice or caloric excess alone. Mounting evidence points to underlying neurobehavioral dysfunction, exacerbated by environments engineered to promote overconsumption. Modern obesity is driven by five interrelated neurobehavioral factors: cue-evoked eating, habitual-context eating, food addiction, emotional eating, and restrained eating. These maladaptive eating patterns arise from a decoupling of homeostatic and hedonic brain circuits in an obesogenic environment. This review synthesizes evidence from neuroimaging, behavioral experiments, and animal studies to illustrate how each factor contributes to obesity risk and relapse after weight loss. We further discuss emerging interventions -including digital therapeutics (DTx) and electroceuticals-that target these drivers with increasing precision. DTx platforms deliver scalable, phenotype-informed interventions through cognitive-behavioral modules, real-time monitoring, and artificial intelligence-driven coaching. Electroceutical strategies, including non-invasive brain stimulation and vagus nerve modulation, show promise in reshaping dysfunctional circuits. Finally, we propose a neurobehavioral subtyping model to guide personalized obesity treatment, integrating brain-based phenotyping with multimodal interventions. This framework may offer a path toward sustained and mechanism-driven obesity care.",2025,[],[]
Longitudinal blood pressure and body mass index in South African adolescents.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Blood pressure (BP) is known to be affected by body mass index (BMI) from an early age, but research in South African youth is scarce. We assessed longitudinal trends and relationships between BP measures and BMI in a South African adolescent cohort.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This longitudinal study (2010-2014) included 121 South African adolescent boys and girls of Black and White ethnicity from the Physical Activity Health Longitudinal Study. Measures included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure, mid-blood pressure (Mid-BP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and BMI.<h4>Results</h4>Over four years, significant increases (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in BMI, SBP, DBP, PP, Mid-BP, and MAP were observed in adolescents (<i>p</i> < 0.001). BMI was consistently and positively associated with various BP measures across the study period. In 2012, BMI associated with SBP (<i>β</i> = 0.22; <i>p</i> = 0.018), DBP (<i>β</i> = 0.22; <i>p</i> = 0.018), Mid-BP (<i>β</i> = 0.24; <i>p</i> = 0.009), and MAP (<i>β</i> = 0.24; <i>p</i> = 0.009). These associations persisted in 2013, with stronger relationships observed for SBP (<i>β</i> = 0.27; <i>p</i> = 0.003), DBP (<i>β</i> = 0.21; <i>p</i> = 0.030), Mid-BP (<i>β</i> = 0.27; <i>p</i> = 0.004), and MAP (<i>β</i> = 0.27; <i>p</i> = 0.005). In 2014, BMI associated with Mid-BP (<i>β</i> = 0.22; <i>p</i> = 0.017) and MAP (<i>β</i> = 0.23; <i>p</i> = 0.015). After adjusting for the previous year's BP, BMI positively associated with SBP (<i>β</i> = 0.23; <i>p</i> = 0.013) in 2013 and DBP (<i>β</i> = 0.19; <i>p</i> = 0.049) in 2014. Significant associations remained between BMI and Mid-BP (<i>β</i> = 0.18-0.21; <i>p</i> = 0.022-0.047) and MAP (<i>β</i> = 0.19-0.20; <i>p</i> = 0.028-0.045) across 2012 and 2013.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Cumulatively increasing BP significantly and positively associated with BMI, suggesting that increasing BMI may contribute to elevated BP during adolescence. Early identification and targeted lifestyle interventions are required to mitigate obesity-related elevated BP in South African adolescents.",2025,[],[]
Visceral adipose tissue regulatory T cells: A potential new target for treating atherosclerosis.,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is the primary potential contributor to cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity (OB)-induced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation is closely related to AS. This VAT inflammation can cause excessive proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines to enter the blood circulation, resulting in an accumulation of immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines within the arterial wall, thereby leading to vascular dysfunction and facilitating the formation of AS. Studies in animal models suggest that regulatory T cells (Tregs) present in VAT have the function of inhibiting VAT inflammation and improving metabolic disorders, thereby reducing the risk factors that induce AS. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this review, we summarize the potential mechanisms by which VAT-Treg regulate VAT inflammation, as well as relevant methods and drugs to enhance Tregs. This aims to provide a reference for assisting in the treatment of AS.",2025,['v'],[]
Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Physical Fitness in Obesity Using Fox vs. Tanaka's Maximum Heart Rate and Percentage vs. Karvonen Methods.,"The intensity of aerobic exercise is influenced by maximum heart rate (MHR), which can be assessed through an incremental exercise test. However, this method requires specialized equipment and a level of fitness that individuals who are sedentary or overweight may lack. Therefore, estimating MHR using formulas is essential. Various methods exist to calculate MHR, but their effectiveness in real exercise programs for obese individuals remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise using different intensity calculation methods, specifically comparing Fox's and Tanaka's maximum heart rate (MHR) equations, as well as the Percentage and Karvonen methods for target heart rate (THR). Seventy-eight men aged 20 to 30 with a body fat percentage of over 20% were divided into one control group and four aerobic exercise groups. EG1 and EG3 used Fox's and Tanaka's equations for MHR and THR from the percentage, while EG2 and EG4 applied the Karvonen method for THR. Participants engaged in 45 minutes of moderate-intensity walking or running on a treadmill four days a week for 12 weeks. Body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, resting heart rate (RHR), and VO<sub>2</sub> max were measured at baseline and after the intervention. After 12 weeks, all exercise groups demonstrated significant improvements in VO<sub>2</sub> max, as well as reductions in body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and resting heart rate (RHR), whereas the control group showed no changes. No significant differences were found among the exercise groups. Aerobic exercise at various intensities effectively enhances cardiovascular fitness and body composition in obese individuals, indicating that these methods are equally beneficial.",2025,[],[]
Mogroside V: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic applications.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mogroside V (MV) constitutes the primary bioactive compound within Siraitia grosvenorii and has significant therapeutic effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, and nervous system damage. Presently, there exists a shortage of comprehensive reviews explaining its therapeutic mechanisms through core signaling pathways.<h4>Aim</h4>To systematically organize and summarize recent advances MV's molecular mechanisms and its therapeutic potential.<h4>Methods</h4>The potential mechanisms of MV on the above diseases were explored by searching relevant literature published in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, combined with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.<h4>Results</h4>MV mediates its multifaceted biological functions via key signaling cascades. Anti-inflammatory actions are facilitated through pathways of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), Protein kinase B/ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-unfolded protein response (ERS-UPR). For anti-oxidant defense, MV predominantly engages the Nuclear (factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1) Nrf2/HO-1, PI3K/Akt, and sirtuin (SIRT) pathways. Furthermore, MV regulates metabolism and offers therapeutic potential by targeting the AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) pathway in obesity, modulating the PI3K/Akt/ glucose transporter type 2(GLUT2) axis for diabetes management, and activating the Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 (TUG1) pathway to enhance osteogenesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MV is a promising multi-target therapeutic candidate.

Targeting metabolic syndrome with ALIAmides: A novel multi-mechanistic approach.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a growing clinical challenge worldwide, significantly increasing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risk, and all-cause mortality. Defined by a constellation of risk factors, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, MetS is frequently associated with hepatic involvement such as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A growing body of evidence also highlights intestinal barrier dysfunction called ""leaky-gut syndrome"" and gut microbiota dysbiosis as key contributors to the chronic low-grade inflammation that underlies MetS. Current therapies, including statins, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and antihypertensives, target individual components of the syndrome but fail to address its multifactorial pathophysiology. Additionally, these therapies often demonstrate tolerability issues, limited long-term adherence and compliance, and potential side effects particularly in hepatic and metabolic contexts. ALIAmides such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) are emerging as promising adjunctive agents for MetS. By activating PPARs, modulating immune responses, and restoring gut barrier integrity, these compounds provide a multi-targeted strategy that addresses the complex pathophysiology of MetS. This review summarizes current evidence on ALIAmides, highlighting their potential to complement standard care and improve long-term metabolic outcomes.",2025,"['insulin', 's', 'glp - 1 receptor', 's', '##glt2']","['insulin', 'glp 1 receptor']"
Diagnostic and Therapeutic Value of the Exercise-Induced Myokine Irisin in Cancer Biology: A Comprehensive Review.,"<b>Objectives:</b> Cancer is a multifactorial disease determined by several factors. Metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes significantly contribute to cancer risk by promoting chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and hormonal dysregulation. Obesity and hyperglycaemia elevate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, driving oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, which promote tumour proliferation and survival. Furthermore, cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, characterised by increased reliance on glycolysis (Warburg effect), facilitating tumour growth and therapy resistance. Hence, body weight reduction and glycaemic control may represent potential strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. Irisin, a myokine secreted by skeletal muscle, plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin may exert tumour-suppressive effects by modulating key metabolic and oncogenic pathways. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic literature search identified studies investigating irisin's effects in various cancer models. <b>Results:</b> In vitro, irisin exerts dose- and time-dependent anti-proliferative effects in a variety of cancer cell lines, primarily via PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition and AMPK activation, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, irisin inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which suppresses cancer cell migration and invasion. However, conflicting findings, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggest tissue-specific responses. Similarly, clinical data regarding systemic and tumoural irisin levels remain inconsistent and appear to vary based on cancer type and stage. <b>Conclusions:</b> Irisin represents a promising therapeutic target due to its ability to modulate metabolic and oncogenic pathways. However, further research is needed to elucidate its clinical relevance and optimise its application as an adjunct to existing cancer therapies.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin - like growth factor - 1', 'igf - 1', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'mtor', 'irisin', 'irisin', 'irisin', 'irisin', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'mtor', 'ampk', 'irisin', 'irisin', 'irisin']","['insulin', 'insulin like growth factor 1', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'mtor', 'irisin', 'ampk']"
Targeting the Gut Microbiota's Role in Host Energy Absorption With Precision Nutrition Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity.,"The field of precision nutrition aims to develop dietary approaches based on individual biological factors such as genomics or the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which is the highly individualized and complex community of microbes residing in the colon, is a key contributor to human physiology. Although gut microbes play multiple roles in the metabolism of nutrients, their role in modulating the absorption of dietary energy from foods that escape digestion in the small intestine has the potential to variably affect energy balance and, thus, body weight. The fate of this energy, and its subsequent impact on body weight, is well described in rodents and is emerging in humans. This narrative review is focused on recent clinical evidence of the role of the gut microbiota in human energy balance, specifically its impact on energy available to the human host. Despite recent progress, remaining gaps in knowledge present opportunities for developing and implementing strategies to understand causal microbial mechanisms related to energy balance. We propose that implementing rigorous microbiota-focused measurements in the context of innovative clinical trial designs will elucidate integrated diet-host-gut microbiota mechanisms. These mechanisms are primed to be targets for precision nutrition interventions to optimize energy balance to achieve desired weight outcomes. Given the magnitude and impact of the obesity epidemic, implementing these interventions within comprehensive weight management paradigms has the potential to be of public health significance.",2025,[],[]

Bromelain in Obesity Therapy: A Review of Anti-Inflammatory and Metabolic Mechanisms.,"The increasing prevalence of obesity, a chronic disease, necessitates the development and evaluation of evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies tailored to heterogeneous populations. Certain fruits, including papaya and pineapple (<i>Ananas comosus</i>), have been investigated as potential dietary components in obesity management. In the context of obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation, bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme derived from pineapple, is a widely studied phytotherapeutic agent that acts through multiple mechanisms intersecting immune and metabolic pathways. This narrative review summarizes current evidence on the effects of bromelain in obesity, low-grade inflammation, and related metabolic disturbances. Searches of the literature were conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases. This review incorporates findings from in vitro, animal, and human studies. We outline the mechanisms and evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy of bromelain, emphasizing its implications for obesity management in clinical settings. Bromelain has been shown to exert significant anti-inflammatory activity and may modulate adipocyte metabolism, potentially alleviating comorbidities associated with excess adiposity. Although its effects on immune cells are relatively well described, the mechanisms underlying bromelain's actions on adipocytes remain incompletely understood.",2025,[],[]
Socioeconomic inequalities in waist circumference and its 12-year change: Moderation by neighbourhood population density.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Reducing socioeconomic inequalities in obesity is a public health priority. We examined whether population density, a key environmental characteristic associated with obesity, moderates the associations of area-level socioeconomic status (SES) with waist circumference and its rate of change.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from adults in an Australian national study, collected across three waves (1999-2000, 2005-06, 2011-12), were used. Outcomes were objectively measured baseline waist circumference (<i>N</i> = 4835) and its rate of change (<i>N</i> = 1158). Exposure was baseline area-level SES. Baseline population density was calculated within a 1 km buffer around residences. Multilevel regression models were used.<h4>Results</h4>Higher area-level SES was associated with smaller baseline waist circumference (-1.45, 95 % CI [-2.28, -0.12]) but not with change over time (0.04, 95 % CI [-0.02, 0.09]). In stratified cross-sectional analyses, this association was significant in lower- (-5.00, 95 % CI -7.73, -2.28]) and medium-density (-2.61, 95 % CI [-4.55, -0.67]), but not in higher-density areas (-0.54, 95 % CI [-1.73,0.65]). In longitudinal analyses, lower SES was linked to smaller increases in waist circumference in lower- (0.16, 95 % CI [0.03, 0.29]) and medium-density (0.17, 95 % CI [0.05, 0.30]) areas, suggesting a narrowing of socioeconomic inequalities in obesity. However, annual changes were modest and unlikely to offset baseline inequalities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Population density moderated associations of area-level SES with waist circumference and its change. Inequalities in baseline obesity were pronounced in lower density areas but not higher density areas. While the longitudinal findings of the moderation patterns were different from baseline results, they suggest persistent socioeconomic inequalities in obesity in lower density areas.",2025,[],[]
Acupuncture and nutritional parallels in obesity: a narrative review of multi-pathway modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder that is intricately linked to dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), a key pathway also targeted by nutritional interventions. Acupuncture, as a non-pharmacological and integrative approach, has shown promising effects in weight control and metabolic improvement, yet its underlying mechanisms remain to be systematically clarified from a nutritional and metabolic perspective. This review outlines an integrative framework by which acupuncture modulates obesity through the MGBA, emphasizing shared targets with diet-based interventions such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and G protein-coupled receptors (e.g., GPR43). We discuss how acupuncture improves microbial diversity, enhances gut barrier integrity, and regulates nutrient-derived signaling molecules, thereby influencing energy metabolism, appetite control, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we explore the convergence of neural, endocrine, and immune networks within the MGBA, positioning acupuncture as a systemic metabolic modulator analogous to nutritional therapeutics. This conceptual model provides novel insights into multi-targeted interventions for obesity, suggesting that acupuncture may serve as a complementary strategy to nutritional modulation in restoring metabolic homeostasis.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'g', '##lp - 1', 'g protein - coupled receptors', 'gpr43']","['glucagon like peptide 1', 'g protein coupled receptors', 'gpr43']"
Development of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Grade-Based Framework on the Pharmacological Treatment of Obesity: Design and Methodological Aspects.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The aim of this study was to describe the design and methodological aspects of the upcoming European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Framework for the Pharmacological Treatment of Obesity utilizing currently available evidence, which is grounded in a rigorous and transparent approach to evidence synthesis and guideline development.<h4>Methods</h4>An expert panel of 13 members, selected by EASO, has developed the framework using the GRADE methodology to ensure transparent, evidence-based guideline development. Clinical questions were formulated using the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) framework, focusing on the effectiveness and safety of European Medicines Agency-approved obesity management medications, including orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. A comprehensive literature search is being conducted using Medline and Embase, including randomized controlled trials with a minimum duration of 48 weeks. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses are planned to compare treatment effectiveness and safety profiles across various patient subgroups. The guidelines will target adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2 and at least one weight-related comorbidity or a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. The primary endpoint will be total body weight loss. Secondary outcomes include changes in body composition (i.e., fat mass, fat-free mass), metabolic improvements (i.e., glucose levels, HbA1c, lipid profile), remission of obesity-related comorbidities (i.e., type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and knee osteoarthritis), and improvements in mental health and quality of life. The methodological framework ensures that recommendations are tailored, evidence-based, and applicable across clinical settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The EASO framework provides a structured and individualized approach to optimize pharmacological treatment for obesity. Its methodological rigor, based on GRADE and PICO, enhances the reliability, reproducibility, and clinical relevance of the guidelines. By integrating clinical efficacy, safety outcomes, and patient-specific factors, this framework offers solid, actionable guidance to support healthcare professionals in delivering high-quality, personalized obesity care.",2025,['hba1c'],['hba1c']
"Overview of prevention and treatment approaches: a summary from the European association for research on obesity in childhood ""Prevention of Obesity"" symposium.","With childhood obesity being one of the most common pediatric chronic diseases, years of extensive prevention experiences still show shortcomings. To gather a discussion over first-hand obesity prevention interventions, the European Association for Research on Obesity in Childhood and the Austrian Academic Institute for Nutritional Medicine organized an international symposium on ""Prevention of Obesity"" in October 2023 (Vienna, Austria). . This report aimed to summarize what researchers from Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and Norway presented and discussed regarding different childhood obesity prevention (and treatment) models implemented in their countries. Using the Ecological Systems Theory framework, we mapped strategies across individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy levels. Family-based interventions were considered best practices; education and counseling on parenting in the context of pediatric obesity is key, as well as using incentives, reminders, and feedback support. Financial support through sufficient personnel and materials budgets, interventions implementation, ongoing result analysis, and program sustainability was considered crucial for long-term success in preventing obesity. While most strategies focused on individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels, fewer directly addressed the community or policy levels, highlighting opportunities for more integrated, system-wide approaches.",2025,[],[]
"Diagnostic value and mediation effects of the visceral adiposity index, triglyceride-glucose index, and platelet-to-HDL ratio in young overweight and obese Chinese adults.","<h4>Background</h4>Evidence on the combined diagnostic and mediating effects of visceral adiposity index (VAI), triglyceride-glucose index (TyGi), and platelet-to-HDL ratio (PHR) in young overweight and obese adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS) is limited.<h4>Methods</h4>Overweight or obese patient from the Integrated Diagnosis and Treatment Center for Obesity were enrolled. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between the three markers and MetS severity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated their diagnostic value, and mediation analysis explored their interrelationships.<h4>Results</h4>Among 331 young adults (median age: 31 years; 60% female), the MetS prevalence was 30.2%. Levels of VAI, TyGi, and PHR were significantly higher in participants with MetS and were strongly associated with MetS severity. Their areas under the curve (AUCs) (VAI: 0.825, TyGi: 0.807, PHR: 0.683) outperformed that of waist circumference (0.604). While the combined use of all three markers yielded the highest AUC, it did not significantly exceed that of VAI alone. Mediation analysis revealed complex interrelationships: TyGi had the strongest total effect on MetS (43.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.05), with substantial mediation by VAI (58.6%) and PHR (10.4%). The effect of VAI (12.2%) was partly mediated by TyGi (30.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.05), whereas the influence of PHR (7.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.05) was largely mediated by VAI (68.6%) and TyGi (61.3%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>VAI, TyGi, and PHR are valuable diagnostic markers for MetS in young overweight and obese Chinese adults, with VAI showing the strongest predictive performance. Their interplay highlights the need for integrated interventions targeting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, and inflammation to mitigate MetS progression.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>https://www.chictr.org.cn/index.html, identifier ChiCTR2400082205.",2025,"['platelet - to - hdl', 'p', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Diet-induced obesity in mice increases carotid body chemosensitivity via the leptin-TRPM7 pathway.,"Diet-induced obesity (DIO) is associated with increased circulating level of the hormone leptin. We have previously shown that leptin augments hypoxic ventilatory response in mice, and the response is abolished by carotid body (CB) denervation, and that leptin induces hypertension in DIO acting on transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (Trpm7) channels in CB. However CB chemosensory responses in DIO have not been sufficiently elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of DIO and leptin on carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity and the role of Trpm7 at normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We measured afferent CSN activity using a novel ex vivo perfused CB preparation in four groups of mice on the C57BL/6J background: lean wild type, DIO wildtype, Trpm7<sup>flox</sup>-DIO transfected with adenoviral vectors harbouring Cre-recombinase and green fluorescent protein (Ad-Cre-GFP) or control GFP (Ad-GFP). Leptin augmented CSN responses to normoxic (PO<sub>2</sub> = 100 Torr) and hypoxic (PO<sub>2</sub> = 60 Torr) conditions. Compared to lean male mice, in DIO mice (a) CSN response to hypoxia was 50% greater, (b) leptin had a greater impact on CSN activity at normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Leptin-induced CSN activities were attenuated by Trpm7 antagonist FTY720 and by Trpm7 knockdown in CB. There was no significant difference between CB chemosensitivity response to leptin in male and female mice. We conclude that CB chemosensitivity is increased in DIO compared to lean mice, and CB Trpm7 channel could be a therapeutic target for obesity-related hypertension. KEY POINTS: We have developed a novel ex vivo perfused murine carotid body (CB) preparation to evaluate carotid sinus nerve (CSN) activity using physiologically relevant levels of PO<sub>2</sub> at normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) increases baseline (normoxic) CSN activity, independent of leptin. DIO augments CB hypoxic chemoreflex gain via leptin. The effect of leptin on CB hypoxic chemoreflex is completely abolished by a Trpm7 blocker FTY720 and prevented by Trpm7 knockdown in CB. FTY720 does not have any effect on CSN activity in the absence of leptin. Taken together our new findings provide direct evidence that obesity increases CB chemoreflex via the leptin-Trpm7 pathway.",2025,"['leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'transient receptor potential melastatin 7', 'trpm7', 'leptin', 'trpm7', 'csn', 'dio', 'trpm7', 'di', 'cre - recombinase', 'green fluorescent protein', 'ad - cre - gfp', '##fp', 'ad - gfp', 'leptin', 'csn', 'csn', 'leptin', 'csn', 'leptin', 'csn', 'trpm7', 'trpm7', 'leptin', 'trpm7', 'cs', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'trpm7', 'fty720', 'trpm7', 'cb', 'fty720', 'c', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'trpm7']","['leptin', 'trpm7', 'csn', 'dio', 'cre recombinase', 'green fluorescent protein', 'fty720']"

Sex-Specific Differences in Adipose IRF5 Expression and Its Association with Inflammation and Insulin Resistance in Obesity.,"Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) plays a pivotal role in innate immune responses and macrophage polarization. Although its role in obesity-associated inflammation has been described, sex-specific differences in adipose IRF5 expression and its association with immune and metabolic markers remain poorly defined. To evaluate sex-specific associations between adipose tissue (AT) IRF5 expression and key inflammatory and metabolic markers in overweight and obese individuals. Subcutaneous AT samples from overweight/obese male and female subjects were analyzed for IRF5 expression using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify its associations with inflammatory gene expression and metabolic parameters including insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, and adipokines. RF5 gene and protein levels were significantly elevated in the AT of overweight/obese females compared to males (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), with expression increasing progressively with BMI in females but not in males. Despite these sex-dependent expression levels, IRF5 demonstrated consistent, sex-independent positive correlations with several core immune and inflammatory markers, including CCR5, CD11c, CD16, CD163, FOXP3, RUNX1, and MyD88. However, distinct sex-specific patterns emerged: in males, IRF5 correlated positively with classical pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IRAK1; whereas in females, IRF5 was associated with a broader array of immune markers, including chemokines (CCL7, CXCL11), pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, TLR8, TLR9), and macrophage markers (CD68, CD86), along with anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and IRF4. Notably, IRF5 expression in overweight/obese males, but not females, was significantly associated with metabolic dysfunction, showing positive correlations with fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels. Multiple regression analyses revealed sex-specific predictors of IRF5 expression, with metabolic (HOMA-IR) and inflammatory (IRAK1, MyD88) markers emerging in males, while immune-related genes (RUNX1, CD68, CCL7, MyD88) predominated in females. These findings underscore a sex-divergent role of IRF5 in AT, with implications for differential regulation of immune-metabolic pathways in obesity and its complications.",2025,"['interferon regulatory factor 5', 'irf5', 'irf5', 'irf5', 'irf5', 'insulin', 'homa - ir', 'rf5 gene', 'irf5', 'ccr5', 'cd11c', 'cd16', 'cd163', 'foxp3', 'runx1', 'myd88', 'irf5', 'il - 2', 'il - 6', 'il - 8', 'tnf - α', 'irak1', 'irf5', 'ccl7', 'cxcl11', 'tlr2', 'tlr8', 'tlr9', 'cd68', 'cd86', 'il - 10', 'irf4', 'irf5', 'hba1c', 'insulin', 'homeostatic model', 'for', 'insulin', 'homa - ir', 'irf5', 'homa -', 'irak1', 'myd88', 'runx1', 'cd68', 'ccl7', 'myd88', 'irf5']","['interferon regulatory factor 5', 'irf5', 'insulin', 'ccr5', 'cd11c', 'cd16', 'cd163', 'foxp3', 'runx1', 'myd88', 'irak1', 'ccl7', 'cxcl11', 'tlr2', 'tlr8', 'tlr9', 'cd68', 'cd86', 'irf4', 'hba1c', 'for']"
Obesity and Heart Failure: Mechanistic Insights and the Regulatory Role of MicroRNAs.,"Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Among its major risk factors, obesity has emerged as a lobal public health concern affecting individuals across all age groups. The rising prevalence of obesity significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, including the development and progression of HF. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules, have garnered attention for their regulatory roles in cardiovascular disease, particularly through post-transcriptional modulation of gene expression. This review highlights the involvement of miRNAs in key pathological processes observed in the obese heart, including cardiac remodeling, apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and myocardial lipotoxicity. Understanding how specific miRNAs and their targets contribute to HF in the context of obesity may inform the development of novel RNA-based therapeutic strategies for cardiometabolic disease.",2025,[],[]
Bisphenol A increases fat mass in adipose tissue by disturbing gut microbiota-dependent bile acid metabolism and TGR5/UCP1 signaling pathways in CD-1 mice.,"Disorder of gut microbiota-mediated bile acid (BA) metabolism plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Our previous research showed that bisphenol A (BPA) exposure induced hepatic fat accumulation and gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, whether the gut microbiota-dependent BA metabolism alteration is involved in BPA-induced fat accumulation and obesity remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbiota-dependent metabolic mechanism of obesity induced by BPA. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to a low dose of BPA (50 μg/kg/day) for six months. Our findings demonstrated that BPA exposure significantly augmented the fat mass of both brown and white adipose tissue, along with the proportion of adipose tissue weight relative to body weight. Furthermore, BPA reduced the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Akkermansia, which are associated with BA metabolism. Additionally, serum levels of lithocholic acid, the most potent activator of Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), and TGR5 expression in adipose tissue were substantially diminished following BPA exposure. Inhibition of TGR5 reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, subsequently decreasing the expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 2 and fibroblast growth factor 21. These changes down-regulated the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), ultimately leading to reduced energy expenditure and increased fat mass. Moreover, further fecal microbiota transplantation and microbiota elimination confirmed the role of gut microbiota in BPA-induced adverse effects. Collectively, our study demonstrated that the suppression of gut microbiota-BA-TGR5/UCP1 signaling pathways may constitute a potential mechanism underlying BPA-induced fat mass gain, providing a novel target for the prevention of BPA-induced obesity.",2025,"['takeda g protein - coupled receptor 5', 'tgr5', 'tgr5', 'tgr5', 'iodothyronine deiodinase 2', 'fibroblast growth factor 21', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'tgr5', 'ucp1']","['tgr5', 'iodothyronine deiodinase 2', 'fibroblast growth factor 21', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
Cryo-EM structure of the full-length LGR4-RSPOs complex and a targeting nanobody for anti-obesity therapy.,"Obesity poses a substantial threat to human health but lacks effective management. Recent advancements in large-scale deep sequencing and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have transformed drug discovery paradigms. Leveraging prior genetics investigation, we pinpointed Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) as a promising target for combating obesity. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of full-length LGR4 alone and in complex with RSPO2(FU). Notably, we develop an inhibitory nanobody (NB21) that blocks the binding of RSPO1/2 to LGR4, and we also determine the structure of the LGR4-NB21 complex. NB21-mFc (NB21 fused with mouse IgG2) effectively inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, thereby enhancing mitochondrial respiration and thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. In vivo, NB21-mFc increases energy expenditure by promoting the browning of white fat, conferring resistance to both diet-induced and genetic (ob/ob) obesity. Furthermore, LGR4 deficiency abolishes the effects of NB21-mFc in boosting the browning program and subsequent weight reduction. In summary, our study unveils structural insights into the LGR4-RSPOs and LGR4-NB21 complexes, paving the way for the development of an LGR4-targeting nanobody for weight loss.",2025,"['leucine - rich repeat - containing g protein - coupled receptor 4', 'lgr4', 'full - length lgr4', 'rspo2', 'fu', 'nb21', 'rspo1 / 2', 'lgr4', 'lgr4', 'nb21', 'nb21', 'mfc', 'nb21', 'mouse igg2', 'wnt', 'nb21', 'mfc', 'lgr4', 'nb21', 'mfc', 'lgr4', 'r', 'lgr4', 'nb21', 'lgr4']","['lgr4', 'rspo2', 'mfc', 'wnt']"
Associations of semaglutide with Alzheimer's disease-related dementias in patients with type 2 diabetes: A real-world target trial emulation study.,"BackgroundAlmost half of the dementia cases are preventable. Semaglutide treats several medical conditions that are risk factors for dementia.ObjectiveWe aim to investigate if semaglutide is associated with a decreased risk of dementia.MethodsWe conducted emulation target trials based on a nationwide population-based database of patient electronic health records (EHRs) in the US among 1,710,995 eligible patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) comparing semaglutide with other antidiabetic medications. First-time diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease-related dementia (ADRD) including vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and other dementias were examined using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses during a 3-year follow-up. Models were adjusted by propensity-score matching.ResultsWe show that semaglutide was associated with a significantly reduced risk of overall ADRD incidence with a hazard ratio ranging from 0.54 (0.49-0.59) compared with insulin, 0.67 (0.61-0.74) compared with metformin, to 0.80 (0.72-0.89) compared with older generation glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1RAs). The association varied for specific dementia types, with significantly reduced risk of vascular dementia and no evidence of associations with frontotemporal and Lewy body dementias.ConclusionsThese findings provide evidence supporting protective effects of semaglutide on dementias in patients with T2D. Future works are needed to establish the causal relationships through randomized clinical trials and to characterize the underlying mechanisms.",2025,"['insulin', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'g', '##lp - 1ras']","['insulin', 'glucagon like peptide 1']"
Ret finger protein deficiency attenuates adipogenesis in male mice with high fat diet-induced obesity.,"Ret finger protein (RFP, also known as TRIM27) is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in transcriptional regulation. While previously reported to repress myogenesis, its role in adipose tissue metabolism remains unclear. Here, using both global and adipocyte-specific RFP-knockout male mice subjected to high-fat diet feeding, we found that RFP deficiency markedly attenuated body weight gain, adipose tissue expansion and adipocyte hypertrophy, while improving glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and circulating lipid profiles. Indirect calorimetry demonstrated significantly increased whole-body energy expenditure, independent of food intake or physical activity. Consistent with these murine findings, RFP expression was elevated in omental adipose tissue from obese human subjects, underscoring the translational relevance. Mechanistic studies revealed that RFP physically interacts with PPAR-γ and enhances its transcriptional activity, thereby promoting expression of adipogenic target genes such as AP2 and adiponectin. Loss of RFP suppressed adipocyte differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our findings identify RFP as a positive regulator of adipogenesis and systemic metabolism via PPAR-γ activation. Genetic ablation of RFP confers resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity, suggesting that targeting RFP may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and related metabolic disorders.",2025,"['ret finger protein', 'rfp', 'trim27', 'e3 ubiquitin ligase', 'rfp', 'rfp', 'insulin', 'rfp', 'rfp', 'ppar - γ', 'ap2', 'adiponectin', 'rfp', 'rfp', 'ppar - γ', 'rfp', 'rfp']","['ret finger protein', 'rfp', 'trim27', 'e3 ubiquitin ligase', 'insulin', 'ap2', 'adiponectin']"
"Associations Between Asprosin, Insulin Resistance, and Oxidative Stress in Adults with Obesity","<title>Abstract</title>  <p>The global increase in obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance (IR) and related metabolic impairments. Asprosin (ASP), a glucogenic adipokine induced by fasting, has recently emerged as a potential biomarker of IR and abnormal body composition. However, its physiological role in obesity remains incompletely understood.To evaluate the associations between serum ASP levels, IR indices, oxidative stress markers, and body composition parameters in overweight and obese adults during a standardized 4-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This cross-sectional study included 150 adults categorized by BMI into three groups: control (CG; BMI < 25 kg/m²), overweight (O1; BMI > 25 kg/m²), and obese (O2; BMI > 30 kg/m²). Participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and biochemical assessment. Measurements included serum ASP, C-peptide, HbA1c, lipid profile, total oxidative capacity (TOC), and total antioxidative capacity (TAC). IR was assessed using HOMA-IR, QUICKI, Matsuda Index, and the Triglyceride-Glucose Index (TyG). Serum ASP levels were significantly higher in O1 and O2 compared with CG (p < 0.001), and in O2 compared with O1 (p < 0.01). ASP positively correlated with fat mass, TOC, HOMA-IR, and TyG (p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with muscle mass, total body water, resting metabolic rate, QUICKI, and Matsuda Index (p < 0.05).In summary, ASP is strongly associated with IR and adverse metabolic profiles in obesity. Its robust correlation with TyG, particularly in individuals with advanced obesity, underscores its potential as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in obesity-related metabolic dysfunction.</p>",2025,"['insulin', 'asprosin', 'asp', 'serum asp', 'serum asp', 'c - peptide', 'hba1c', 'serum asp', 'asp', 'homa', 'asp']","['insulin', 'asprosin', 'asp', 'c peptide', 'hba1c']"
Significance of GNAS mutations for morbid obesity in children.,"<h4>Background</h4>Hereditary forms of obesity are characterized by early severe heterogeneous manifestations of the phenotype along with a rapid progression to morbid obesity, primary due to pathogenic variants of certain genes. Most forms are characterized by moderate to severe neuropsychic developmental delays, dysmorphic features and organ-specific developmental anomalies.<h4>Result</h4>We searched for hereditary causes of morbid obesity in children by exome sequencing. As a result, we have identified 5 variants in the GNAS locus, two of which were identified for the first time: NM_000516.7(GNAS):c.201del, (p.Phe68Leufs*32) and NM_000516.7(GNAS):c.586 - 18_591del. Children showed tolerance to parathyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone. It has been observed that almost all the children with frameshift variants or nonsense mutations presented with subcutaneous ossifications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The search for variants in a group of patients with morbid obesity, as conducted in our research, reaffirms the need for use molecular genetic testing to determine the main diagnosis and facilitate early detection of the disease. This is particularly relevant given the wide clinical variability of monogenic forms of obesity.",2025,"['h', 'g', 'nm', 'parathyroid hormone', '- s', 'h4']",['parathyroid hormone']
Exploring the Emerging Link Between Obesity-Induced Meta-Neuroinflammation and Osteoarthritis Pain Mechanisms,"Obesity is a complex, heterogeneous, chronic and progressive disease, which correlates with an augmented risk to develop several comorbidities with an enhanced risk of death. In addition to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, obesity is related to depressive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, in which gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a central role in triggering the meta-neuroinflammation through the gut-brain axis. In obese patients, the release of inflammatory mediators by dysfunctional adipocytes and the oxidative stress induces meta-neuroinflammation, which have been identified as the main physio-pathological pathway underlying chronic pain syndromes, particularly osteoar-thritis, low back pain, fibromyalgia, headache, and painful diabetic peripheral neu-ropathy. Both the peripheral and the central nervous system are involved in neuroin-flammatory processes, leading to central sensitization and pain chronification. Me-ta-neuroinflammation is also a potential peripheral target of treatment in degenerative joint disease, in order to minimize the traditional pharmacological approaches use. The ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide is able to control the body weight, to exert neuroprotective, anti-neuroinflammatory and analgesic actions, and to restore intestinal eubiosis, with beneficial effects on mental disorders via the gut-brain axis. Finally, adelmidrol, as a PEA congener, available for intra-articular injection associated with hyaluronic acid, has been shown to modulate meta-neuroinflammation in knee osteo-arthritis.",2025,[],[]
"Semaglutide and human reproduction: caution at the intersection of energy balance, ovarian function, and follicular development.","Obese or overweight patients considering IVF are generally counselled to reduce weight closer to target BMI (i.e., < 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) by interventions entailing dietary change with a structured exercise program. There is little disagreement that supervised weight loss can improve reproductive outcome when successful, although there are refractory cases where weight goals are unmet. Because low-grade chronic inflammation and altered immune function are characteristic of obesity and antagonize implantation, any pre-IVF weight loss facilitated by semaglutide (SG) would be helpful. However, no preclinical data have considered the ovarian implications of SG. Several formulations of SG are now available to assist in chronic weight management, treatment of type-2 diabetes, or both. SG is 31-amino acid lipopeptide with action at the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, which augments insulin secretion while lowering hepatic glucagon output. SG thus enters a multiorgan network where insulin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and sirtuin pathways manage ambient nutritional conditions. As GLP-1 directly influences insulin release and curtails satiety, SG adjusts many biochemical cascades where potential interference with oocyte development or embryo/endometrial crosstalk require clarification. Particularly if used outside manufacturer's guidance (i.e., for aesthetic or personal reasons), SG could bring unwelcome challenges to fertility clinics where obesity and dyslipidemia are merely exchanged for the new problems of starvation and sarcopenia. Here we examine known GLP-1 actions where energy balance, ovarian aging, and oocyte competence converge; off label SG use should be avoided until its signaling effects throughout the reproductive axis are more carefully studied.",2025,"['s', 'sg', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'insulin', 'hepatic glucagon', 'sg', 'insulin', 'amp - activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'insulin - like growth factor - 1', 'igf - 1', 'ma', '##mmalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor', 'sirtuin', 'glp - 1', 'insulin', 'sg', '##g', 'glp - 1', 'sg']","['insulin', 'amp activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'insulin like growth factor 1', 'mtor', 'sirtuin', 'glp 1']"
Intracellular fatty acid levels differentially impact target silencing by FDA-approved siRNA drugs.,"With seven approved and many more anticipated over the next decade, small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics have emerged as an innovative class of nucleic acid-based drugs, offering potential treatments for both rare and common diseases. A substantial portion of the patient population affected by these diseases may also present with obesity and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), conditions characterized by excessive accumulation of hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs). However, the impact of intracellular FFA levels on siRNA drug efficacy has not been fully determined. In this study, hepatic HepG2 and HepaRG cells were treated with varying concentrations of oleic and palmitic acids to simulate a microcellular environment with elevated FFA levels. Efficacy in the reduction of targets at both the mRNA and protein levels was determined for three selected Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved siRNA drugs, patisiran, vutrisiran, and inclisiran. Our findings demonstrate strong evidence that elevated intracellular FFA levels significantly alter the efficacy of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs, impacting both mRNA and protein target reduction and highlighting a previously underexplored factor which could impact clinical outcomes. Understanding the impact on siRNA efficacy is critical for optimizing the therapeutic potential of siRNA-based treatments for patients with FFA diseases, such as obesity and MAFLD.",2025,"['ffa', 'ffa', 'ffa']",['ffa']
Rosa roxburghii Tratt fruit extract ameliorate free fatty acid induced steatosis in HepG2 cells through activating PI3K-Akt and PPAR pathways.,"There has been a continuous increase in the global incidence of obesity. Rosa roxburghii Tratt (RRT), a plant with medicinal and edible uses, contains active components that can alleviate obesity, indicating an anti-obesity potential. This research sought to investigate the anti-obesity effects of RRT fruit extract (RRTE) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms and components responsible for its action. RRTE was obtained by enriching the active ingredient in RRT and used to treat HepG2 cells. RRTE alleviated cellular lipid accumulation, reduced reactive oxygen species production, restored cellular mitochondrial function, and enhanced energy metabolism. Network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was used to determine the targets, components, and mechanisms, which were validated through in vitro experiments. p-Coumaric acid and ethyl caffeate were identified as lipid-lowering active components that may reduce lipid accumulation and alleviate obesity through the PI3K-Akt and PPAR signaling pathways.",2025,"['pi3k', 'akt', 'ppar']","['pi3k', 'akt', 'ppar']"
Preoperative Weight Loss Among Morbidly Obese Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: It May Not Affect Outcomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>The increasing obesity rate among total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients presents a growing issue regarding surgical decision-making. Given the association between morbid obesity (MO, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40) and postoperative complications, as well as the technical and physical challenges of performing TKA in MO patients, many professional associations and institutions have adopted guidelines for preoperative weight loss in MO patients undergoing TKA.<h4>Methods</h4>Morbidly obese patients who underwent TKA from 2019 to 2021 were identified. Patients who had < 90 days between their initial appointment and the date of surgery (time before surgery) were excluded. Preoperative characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared between patients who achieved meaningful (≥ 5%) or target (≥ 10%) preoperative weight loss and those who did not. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of weight loss.<h4>Results</h4>Among all 115 patients, 13 (7.8%) gained meaningful weight (≥ 5% BMI increase), 59 (51.3%) did not experience meaningful weight change, and 47 (40.9%) lost meaningful weight, among whom 25 (21.7% of the full cohort) achieved target weight loss. Patients who achieved meaningful/target weight loss had higher preoperative BMI, more time before surgery, and lower proportions of Black patients, Hispanic/Latino patients, and patients undergoing revision surgery (P ≤ 0.038). There were no substantial differences in intraoperative or postoperative outcomes. In multiple logistic regression, higher preoperative BMI, more time before surgery, and non-Black race were independent predictors of weight loss (P ≤ 0.044).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A minority of MO patients achieve meaningful/target weight loss before TKA; however, preoperative weight loss does not appear to affect outcomes. Surgeons should provide more time for MO patients to lose weight preoperatively and more resources to patients (racial and ethnic minorities and those undergoing revision surgery) who may be at greater risk of not achieving meaningful/target weight loss.",2025,[],[]
The role of m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in metabolism-related diseases: Mechanism and clinical implications.,"Metabolism-related diseases, including obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Atherosclerosis (As)，type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and diabetic complications, are rising at an alarming rate globally, significantly increasing the risk of life-threatening conditions. Furthermore, these diseases have emerged as a major public health challenge worldwide. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA molecules, catalyzed by methyltransferase complexes, with methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) serving as the sole catalytic subunit due to its unique structural properties. As a critical component of the m6A methylation mechanism, METTL3 profoundly influences metabolism-related diseases through various pathways, including the regulation of adipocyte differentiation, modulation of key metabolic genes, and mediation of inflammatory responses via cytokine secretion. This article reviews recent research findings that elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying METTL3's involvement in these processes and assesses its potential as a therapeutic target, along with the associated challenges.",2025,"['methyltransferase - like 3', 'mettl3', 'mettl3', 'mettl3']",['mettl3']
Targeting the root cause of obesity-related comorbidities through weight independent and dependent actions on insulin sensitivity: Benefits of dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists.,"Insulin is the major endocrine hormone responsible for regulating whole-body glucose homeostasis by regulating glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissue. Obesity is one of the main factors initiating the development of insulin resistance through increased adipose tissue size, inflammation, and ectopic fat deposition in insulin-sensitive tissues. Inflammation and fat accumulation are key drivers for losing insulin sensitivity and are thereby part of triggering a wide range of pathological conditions and obesity-related comorbidities, in which insulin resistance is central. These included diabetes, liver and cardiovascular complications, musculoskeletal conditions, and neurodegenerative disorders among others. The number of conditions derived from metabolic dysregulation originating from insulin resistance highlights the importance of treating insulin resistance. The management of insulin resistance has evolved significantly with the ongoing growth of therapeutic options. The therapeutic landscape includes both potent weight loss therapies improving insulin sensitivity indirectly and insulin-sensitizing therapies specifically targeting insulin resistance. On the horizon are novel drug candidates like dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists (DACRAs), which elicit weight-loss, but also have insulin-sensitizing properties through a weight-independent action, thereby providing highly relevant additional value to the existing therapeutic options. This review introduces the mechanisms behind insulin resistance, focusing on the key insulin target tissues; skeletal muscle, liver, and white adipose tissue. More importantly, diseases triggered by insulin resistance are described, followed by a highlight of treatments improving insulin sensitivity through different mechanisms of action.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'amylin', 'calcitonin receptor', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'amylin', 'calcitonin receptor']"
Cannabis Improves Metabolic Dysfunction and Macrophage Signatures in Obese Mice.,"Obesity rates continue to rise, highlighting the need for new treatments that are effective, safe, and widely accessible. Aligned with the easing of restrictions on cannabis use, interest in its therapeutic potential is evolving. As such, we examined the effects of the cannabis plant with high cannabidiol (CBD) content or high Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content on metabolic and immune dysregulation in obese mice. Briefly, female C57BL/6 mice were randomized into four groups (n=15/group): 1) Lean, 2) Obese Placebo, 3) Obese CBD, and 4) Obese THC. Lean mice consumed a low-fat diet for the study duration. Obese mice consumed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks prior to a 4-week cannabis (3x/week; high CBD = ~4.2 mg/kg and high THC = ~7.3 mg/kg) intervention. Consistent with our hypothesis, obesity increased Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) both of which were significantly mitigated by either high (10.5%) CBD or high (18.16%) THC cannabis (p<0.05). Interestingly, these changes appeared to occur independent of significant weight loss or measurable changes in food intake. Diet-induced obesity also increased infiltrating macrophages, pan macrophages, and M1-like pro-inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue and liver. These effects were rescued by high CBD and high THC (p<0.05), providing evidence consistent with causation for the improvements in HOMA-IR and MASH. Despite the legal complexities surrounding cannabis use, these data suggest both CBD and THC can be a viable therapy to target macrophages and improve metabolic health and immune dysregulation with obesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'ho', 'homa']",['insulin']
Adiposome Proteomics Uncover Molecular Signatures of Cardiometabolic Risk in Obese Individuals.,"<h4>Background</h4>Adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) are emerging as key mediators of inter-organ communication, yet their molecular composition and role in obesity-related pathophysiology remain underexplored. This study integrates clinical phenotyping with proteomic analysis of visceral adipose-derived adiposomes to identify obesity-linked molecular disruptions.<h4>Methods</h4>Seventy-five obese and forty-seven lean adults were extensively profiled for metabolic, inflammatory, hepatic, and vascular parameters. Adiposomes isolated from visceral fat underwent mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, followed by differential abundance, pathway enrichment, regulatory network modeling, and clinical association testing.<h4>Results</h4>Obese individuals exhibited widespread cardiometabolic dysfunction. Proteomics revealed 64 adiposomal proteins with differential abundance. Upregulated proteins (e.g., CRP, C9, APOC1) correlated with visceral adiposity, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. In contrast, downregulated proteins (e.g., ADIPOQ, APOD, TTR, FGB, FGG) were associated with enhanced nitric oxide bioavailability and vascular protection, suggesting loss of homeostatic signaling. Network analyses identified TNF and IL1 as key upstream regulators driving inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Decision tree and random forest models accurately classified obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis (AUC = 0.908-0.994), identifying predictive protein signatures related to complement activation, inflammation, and lipid transport.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Obesity alters adiposome proteomic cargo, reflecting and potentially mediating systemic inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and vascular impairment.",2025,"['crp', 'c9', 'apoc1', 'ad', 'apod', 'ttr', 'fgb', 'fgg', 'tnf', 'il1']","['crp', 'apoc1', 'apod', 'ttr', 'fgb', 'fgg', 'tnf', 'il1']"
A Case Report of a Simultaneous Pediatric Orthotopic Liver Transplant and Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy in a 10-Year-Old Male With Cirrhosis and Obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Liver transplantation is a lifesaving procedure for children with end-stage liver disease. Obesity and weight gain can lead to post-transplant steatosis and increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery improves outcomes in children with severe obesity by reducing weight and subsequent comorbidities. We present a case of simultaneous orthotopic liver transplant and vertical sleeve gastrectomy.<h4>Methods</h4>Retrospective case report.<h4>Results</h4>An 8-year-old male presented with right upper quadrant pain. Workup demonstrated cirrhosis with portal hypertension due to a vertically transmitted hepatitis C virus (HCV). Despite treatment for HCV, he developed decompensated disease and was listed for liver transplantation at 10 years of age. Due to class 3 severe obesity and associated comorbidities, he underwent a simultaneous vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and deceased donor orthotopic liver transplantation. Postoperative course was complicated by a prolonged oxygen requirement that resolved within 2 weeks. No staple line or gastric bleeding issues were noted. More than 1 year after transplantation, he has good graft function on tacrolimus monotherapy.

Assessing the long-term outcomes of this and other similar patients will assist in the determination of optimal patient selection, target and actual BMI reduction, and metabolic goals in the pediatric liver transplant population.",2025,[],[]
The Cost-Effectiveness of Semaglutide and Tirzepatide for Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis and Obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) lead to substantial weight loss and pain reduction in persons with knee osteoarthritis and obesity.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 2 GLP1RAs, semaglutide and tirzepatide, for patients with osteoarthritis and obesity.<h4>Design</h4>Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated microsimulation model of knee osteoarthritis, to estimate lifetime benefits and costs of weight loss strategies.<h4>Data sources</h4>Published data to derive treatment-related weight loss, pain reduction, and costs of GLP1RAs from the U.S. Office of Health Policy.<h4>Target population</h4>Persons with knee osteoarthritis and obesity in the United States. The base-case cohort had a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain score of 71 (0 to 100, 100 worst) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<h4>Time horizon</h4>Lifetime.<h4>Perspective</h4>Health care, societal.<h4>Intervention</h4>Semaglutide, tirzepatide, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and diet and exercise.<h4>Outcome measures</h4>Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).<h4>Results of base-case analysis</h4>Tirzepatide provided greater health benefits at lower costs than semaglutide and yielded a $57 400 per QALY ICER versus diet and exercise. For those eligible, RYGB provided greater health benefits at lower costs than the 2 GLP1RAs and had a $30 700 per QALY ICER versus LSG.<h4>Results of sensitivity analysis</h4>Tirzepatide's ICER was most sensitive to changes in medication costs, treatment efficacy, and cohort baseline BMI. Tirzepatide had a 64% and semaglutide had a 34% probability of being cost-effective at a $100 000 per QALY threshold.<h4>Limitation</h4>Data from multiple sources.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both tirzepatide and semaglutide would be widely considered cost-effective when compared directly with usual care.

Decline in LDL-C control in patients with dyslipidemia treated with PCSK9-inhibitors: The role of obesity in LDL-C target achievement.,"<h4>Background</h4>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9-Is: alirocumab and evolocumab) have improved dyslipidemia management in patients with high cardiovascular risk. However, some patients fail to reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate factors influencing PCSK9-I therapy effectiveness.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study (2018-2023) analyzed adults treated with a PCSK9-I for at least 6 months with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (He-FH) in primary prevention, dyslipidemia in secondary prevention, or diabetes with associated complications. Clinical, anthropometric data and lipid profiles were collected at baseline and after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. The primary outcome was LDL-C target achievement according to European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>Among 180 patients, approximately 45% achieved the LDL-C target. Patients with overweight and obesity showed significantly lower LDL-C reductions compared to normal-weight patients. Those reductions for overweight patients were 47.8%, 50.0%, and 44.0%, and for obese patients were 25.6%, 29.4%, and 28.6%, whereas normal-weight patients achieved reductions of 54.5% (P = .021), 62.5% (P = .024), and 65.4% (P = .024), respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed these findings (odds ratio [OR]: 0.18, 95% CI, 0.06-0.53, P = .002) and highlighted that He-FH was associated with lower likelihood of achieving LDL-C targets (OR: 0.35, 95% CI, 0.15-0.82, P = .015). Conversely, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were more likely to reach LDL-C targets (OR: 4.54, 95% CI, 1.98-10.41, P < .0001). Concomitant oral lipid-lowering therapy was linked to a higher probability of achieving LDL-C targets compared to PCSK9-I monotherapy (OR: 14.5, 95% CI 2.26-92.9, P = .005).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overweight, He-FH, CAD, and concomitant oral lipid-lowering therapy could influence the achievement of LDL-C target in patients treated with PCSK9-Is.",2025,"['proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9', 'pcsk9 - is', 'low - density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'ldl - c', 'pcsk9 - i', 'pcsk9 - i', 'ldl - c', 'ldl - c', 'ldl - c', 'ldl - c', 'ldl - c', 'ldl - c', 'ldl - c']",['low density lipoprotein cholesterol']
"Integrating network pharmacology, quantitative transcriptomic analysis, and experimental validation revealed the mechanism of cordycepin in the treatment of obesity.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Evidence of the benefits of cordycepin (Cpn) for treating obesity is accumulating, but detailed knowledge of its therapeutic targets and mechanisms remains limited. This study aimed to systematically identify Cpn's therapeutic targets and pathways in Western diet (WD)-induced obesity using integrated network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and experimental validation.<h4>Methods</h4>A Western diet (WD)-induced mice model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of Cpn in ameliorating obesity. A network pharmacology analysis was then employed to identify the potential anti-obesity targets of Cpn. GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to elucidate the potential functions of the identified targets, followed by constructing a protein-protein interaction network to screen the core targets. Meanwhile, quantitative transcriptomics was conducted to validate and broaden the network pharmacology findings. Finally, molecular docking and quantitative real-time PCR assay were used for the core target validation.<h4>Results</h4>Cpn treatment effectively alleviated obesity-related symptoms in WD-induced mice.

Current Data on the Role of Amino Acids in the Management of Obesity in Children and Adolescents.,"Childhood obesity is a major global health problem, and its management involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, and the use of dietary supplements. In this review, we summarize current findings on the role of amino acids in pediatric obesity, with a particular focus on their involvement in metabolic pathways and weight regulation. The involvement of branched-chain and aromatic amino acids in the pathophysiology and potential management of pediatric obesity is highlighted in recent studies. Both experimental and clinical studies have shown that obese children often exhibit altered plasma amino acid profiles, including increased levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, as well as decreased levels of glycine and serine. These imbalances are correlated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and early metabolic dysfunction. One of the mechanisms through which branched-chain amino acids can promote insulin resistance is the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Metabolomic profiling has demonstrated the potential of specific amino acid patterns to predict obesity-related complications before they become clinically evident. Early identification of these biomarkers could be of great help for individualized interventions. Although clinical studies indicate that changes in dietary amino acids could lead to modest weight loss, improved metabolic profiles, and increased satiety, further studies are needed to establish standardized recommendations.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor']","['insulin', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor']"
Identification of Indoquinazoline Derivatives as Novel NR4A1 Agonists by Suppressing Adipocyte Lipogenesis for Treatment of Obesity.,"Developing safe and effective antiobesity therapies through lipid metabolism regulation remains challenging. Our previous research identified the indolequinazoline-based compound <b>R17</b> as a promising lead with significant lipid-lowering activity in a 3T3-L1 cell model, but its direct molecular target was unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <b>R17</b> is a novel agonist of the nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) by activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) as well as the validation of targets and pharmacological effects both intracellularly and extracellularly. It has been reported the ameliorative effect of NR4A1 activation on obesity. Further mechanistic studies showed that <b>R17</b> suppressed lipid anabolism-related genes through NR4A1-mediated transcriptional repression, thereby inhibiting triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Furthermore, we established a correlation between the NR4A1 binding affinity of <b>R17</b> derivatives and their lipid-lowering potency. These findings highlight <b>R17</b> derivatives as a novel class of NR4A1-targeting antiobesity agents and support pharmacological NR4A1 activation as a promising therapeutic strategy.",2025,"['nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group a member 1', 'nr4a1', 'nr4a1', 'nr4a1', 'nr4a1', 'nr4a1', 'nr4a1']","['nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group a member 1', 'nr4a1']"
Epigenetic Changes Associated With Obesity-related Metabolic Comorbidities.,"Obesity arises from a complex interaction of genetic, hormonal, dietary, and behavioral factors that drive chronic energy imbalance, excessive fat accumulation, systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance, thus increasing the risk of metabolic diseases. Recent evidence suggests a significant role for epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in patterns of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility, in the aetiology, progression, and intergenerational transmission of obesity risk. In this review, we first explore the link between cellular metabolism and epigenetics in the context of an obesogenic environment and highlight the mechanisms leading to cell-type and sex-specific epigenetic changes. We then highlight recent human studies that uncovered epigenetic alterations in key metabolic organs that distinguish metabolically healthy obesity from obesity complicated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Mechanistic studies performed in the mouse support an important role for epigenetic mechanisms in driving the metabolic comorbidities of obesity. Given the difficulty of accessing tissues directly implicated in metabolic homeostasis, peripheral blood epigenetic biomarkers offer insights into the pathogenesis of these metabolic comorbidities of obesity and may predict their future development. The dynamic and reversible nature of obesity-associated epigenetic changes underscores their therapeutic potential. Future research should address challenges such as tissue specificity, interactions with genetic variants, and the functional impact of epigenetic alterations. Expanding studies on intergenerational inheritance, RNA modifications, and the development of epigenetic therapies hold promise for mitigating the impact of obesity-related metabolic comorbidities and informing precision interventions in clinical practice.",2025,"['insulin', 'histone', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'histone']"
Obesity and the Gut-Brain Axis in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Terra Incognita?,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The increasing prevalence of obesity among individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) presents a significant clinical challenge, as it exacerbates insulin resistance, impairs glycemic control, and increases cardiometabolic risk. While obesity in T1DM is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, recent evidence highlights the role of the gut-brain axis in metabolic regulation. This review explores the complex relationship between obesity and T1DM, the role of the gut-brain axis in metabolic dysregulation, and current weight management strategies, highlighting the need for further research to optimize treatment outcomes in this unique patient population.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Key gastrointestinal hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and amylin, play essential roles in appetite control, energy balance, and glucose metabolism, yet their dysregulation in T1DM remains poorly understood. Addressing obesity requires a multifaceted approach, including lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and bariatric surgery (BS). Although limited, accumulating evidence regarding the use of liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide in T1DM begin to highlight the safety and effectiveness of these molecules in this subset of patients as well. Lifestyle modifications, GLP-1 RAs based pharmacotherapy and BS have emerged as potential strategies to address obesity in patients with T1DM. Initial findings point to potential improvements in both metabolic health and glycemic control, but further exploration of their role in the co-occurrence of obesity and T1DM remains limited. Ongoing research is crucial to better understand how the gut-brain axis influences weight regulation in T1DM and to determine the sustained benefits and risks of these emerging therapies.",2025,"['insulin', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'gip', 'amylin', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1 ras']","['insulin', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'glp 1', 'glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'gip', 'amylin', 'glp 1 receptor']"

While initially shown to significantly reduce adipose tissue through decreased food intake, incretin-based therapy is also increasingly reported to alter the properties of adipose tissue. Recent experimental and human studies indicate that these anti-obesity drugs induce significant changes in the metabolism and inflammatory state of adipose tissue, while also promoting its thermogenic plasticity.

Obesity-associated macrophages dictate adipose stem cell ferroptosis and visceral fat dysfunction by propagating mitochondrial fragmentation.,"Morbid obesity induces adipose stem cell (ASC) shortage that impairs visceral adipose tissue (VAT) homeostasis. Macrophages cooperate with ASCs to regulate VAT metabolism, their impact on ASC shortage remains elusive. TNF-α-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) is an important regulator in immune cells, its expression in VAT macrophages and function in macrophage-ASC crosstalk are largely unknown. Here, TIPE2 loss in VAT macrophages promotes ASC ferroptosis to aggravate diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders in male mice, which can be corrected by macrophage-specific TIPE2 restoration in VAT. Mechanistically, TIPE2-deficient macrophages propagate mitochondrial fragmentation and reduce delivery of exosomal ferritin toward ASCs, resulting in mitochondrial ROS and Fe<sup>2+</sup> overload that dictates ASC ferroptosis. TIPE2 interacts with IP3R to constrain IP3R-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Drp1 axis, thereby preventing excessive mitochondrial fission and enabling macrophages to protect against ASC ferroptosis. This study reveals distinct obesity-associated macrophages that dictate ASC ferroptosis, and proposes macrophage TIPE2 as therapeutic target for obesity-related diseases.",2025,"['tnf - α - induced protein 8 - like 2', 'tipe2', 'tipe2', 'tipe2', 'tipe2', 'ex', 'ferritin', 'tipe2', 'ip3r', 'ip3r - ca', 'drp1', 'tipe2']","['tipe2', 'ferritin', 'drp1']"
Role of curcumin in altering gut microbiota for anti-obesity and anti-hyperlipidemic effects.,"Obesity significantly impacts the health and economy of modern society, and the prevention and treatment of obesity is a key focus of social research. The main reason for obesity is the excessive accumulation of body fat due to metabolic dysfunction, which may result in atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid metabolism. So far, a number of mechanisms of intestinal flora and plant extracts have been found and applied to the treatment of obesity. However, because of the complexity of gut microbiota composition, it is still not clear which microbiota has a direct relationship with obesity. Curcumin (CUR) has a long-standing and important position in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is a polyphenolic compound derived from the rhizome of <i>Curcuma longa</i>. CUR has been widely studied in recent years for its multiple biological activities. In addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, CUR also shows potential in anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and neuroprotective effects. This review aims to systematically synthesize the current evidence on the effects and mechanisms of CUR targeting gut microbiota in obesity treatment, analyze the progress of CUR research in fat reduction and weight loss, and specifically clarify its role in modulating gut microbiota to exert both anti-obesity and anti-hyperlipidemic effects. By doing so, we seek to illuminate the intricate relationship between CUR, gut microbiota, and obesity with associated hyperlipidemia.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']

"Obesity is associated with reduced sensitivity to stimulus rewarding value, but unaltered effects of fasting and contextual modulation during action prediction.","Previous studies have shown that our perception of others' actions is influenced by both the reward value of target objects and our internal motivational state. In the present study, we investigated how the energy content of the target object and the physiological state of hunger influence the prediction of food-oriented actions in people with a healthy weight or obesity. Thirty-one participants with normal-weight and 31 participants with obesity performed a social perception task in which, under a fasting or a satiety state, they had to predict the intention of actions directed to high- or low-energy food objects in the context of a breakfast table that could suggest congruent or incongruent actions compared to action kinematics. The results showed that action prediction performance was greater: 1) for high-compared to low-energy food objects in the group with healthy weight but not in the group with obesity, with lower sensitivity to the energy content of the target object in individuals with more weight; 2) under a fasting compared to a satiety state in both groups; 3) for actions embedded in congruent compared to incongruent contexts when directed to high- but not low-energy food objects, independently of group and hunger state. The findings document an altered sensitivity to the reward value of action stimuli in people with obesity, despite a conserved sensitivity to hunger and contextual modulation. This supports a reduced sensitivity to the reward value of food stimuli in people with obesity pointing at a dysfunctional reward system during action perception. Interestingly, being under a food deprivation state comparably boosted performance in both groups, providing evidence that fasting may sharpen senses independently from individual weight.",2025,[],[]
Iron-Inflammasome Crosstalk in Adipose Tissue: Unresolved Roles of NLRP3 and IL-1β in Metabolic Inflammation.,"Iron is essential for cellular respiration, oxidative defense, and host immunity, but its dysregulation is increasingly associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. In these diseases, regional iron accumulation occurs in adipose tissue, independent of systemic overload. This process disrupts the mitochondrial redox balance, induces ferroptotic stress, and activates the innate immune pathways. Recent studies have highlighted the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome and its effector cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as important mediators of the interface between iron and inflammation. In both adipocytes and macrophages, labile iron increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promoted inflammasome formation. Simultaneously, metabolic stress factors upregulate hepcidin expression, suppress ferroportin activity and exacerbate intracellular iron retention. These molecular events converge to maintain low-grade inflammation and impair insulin signaling. Despite these compelling associations, direct mechanistic evidence remains limited, particularly with respect to depot-specific responses and cell type resolution. In this review, I examine the current evidence linking iron handling and inflammasome biology in adipose tissue, focusing on ferroptosis, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) signaling, and spatial mapping of iron-cytokine networks. I also discuss novel therapeutic strategies targeting iron overload and inflammasome activation, including chelation, hepcidin modulation, and inflammasome inhibition in the context of metabolic diseases.",2025,"['nlrp3', 'rich', 'pyrin domain - containing protein 3', 'cytoki', 'interleukin - 1β', 'il - 1β', 'hepcidin', 'ferroportin', 'insulin', 'thioredoxin - interacting protein', 'txnip', 'hepcidin']","['nlrp3', 'hepcidin', 'ferroportin', 'insulin', 'thioredoxin interacting protein', 'txnip']"
Adipocyte RNA-binding protein CELF1 promotes beiging of white fat through stabilizing Dio2 mRNA.,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate diverse post-transcriptional processes and play roles in adipocyte development; however, their role in white fat beiging remains unclear. Here we identify CUG-BP Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1) as a key RBP promoting beiging of inguinal white adipose tissue in response to cold. Adipocyte-specific Celf1 deficiency impairs cold-induced thermogenic gene expression and reduces energy expenditure. Mechanistically, CELF1 binds to the 3'UTR of Dio2 mRNA and enhances its stability, promoting local triiodothyronine (T3) production. Notably, CELF1 expression is significantly reduced in subcutaneous fat of individuals with obesity and negatively correlates with BMI. CELF1 enhances isoproterenol-induced beige adipocyte activation and mitochondrial respiration in vitro, and Celf1 overexpression ameliorates diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Hence, our study identifies CELF1 as a physiological regulator of metabolic stress in activating thermogenesis and promoting energy expenditure at the post-transcriptional level, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic diseases.",2025,"['rna - binding proteins', 'rbps', 'cug - bp elav - like family member 1', 'celf1', 'r', '##p', 'celf1', 'celf1', 'dio2 mrna', 'celf1', 'celf1', 'celf1', 'celf1']","['rna binding proteins', 'rbp', 'celf1']"

"Hyperglycemia worsens gut bacterial infection through intestinal Wnt, but independent of endotoxemia or obesity.","Obesity and diabetes are interlinked diseases, but it was unclear how obesity vs. diabetes modifies the risk and severity of gut bacterial infection. We aimed to determine how obesity or hyperglycemia, indicative of diabetes, altered metabolic endotoxemia and severity of enteric infection. Metabolic endotoxemia was determined using TLR4 activity reporter assay in serum from humans with obesity or diabetes, and from hyperglycemic <i>Akita</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice and genetically obese <i>ob/ob</i> mice. Diarrhea severity during <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection was determined in humans during a previous community outbreak. The enteropathogen <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> was used to define the mechanisms of action that altered the severity of enteric infection in <i>ob/ob</i> and <i>Akita</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice. We found that elevated blood glucose, indicative of diabetes, was associated with increased occurrence and severity of diarrhea during an <i>E. coli</i> outbreak in humans. Metabolic endotoxemia occurred in a separate cohort of people with obesity who were normoglycemic or hyperglycemic, and in mice with either obesity or hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia, not obesity, increased mortality during infection with the diarrhea-causing pathogen <i>C. rodentium</i> in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Common indicators of poor prognosis, such as gut pathology, systemic bacteraemia, or metabolic endotoxemia, did not predict worse outcomes during enteric infection in diabetic mice. Hyperglycemia activated intestinal Wnt/β-catenin and increased mortality, which could be reversed by blocking Wnt/β-catenin, lowering blood glucose, or restoring fluid balance during infection. The increased severity of infection via overactivation of intestinal Wnt/β-catenin during hyperglycemia may be a potential target for therapeutics.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We show that elevated blood glucose is associated with worse diarrhea during an <i>Escherichia coli</i> outbreak in humans. Obesity or hyperglycemia was sufficient to promote metabolic endotoxemia in humans and mice. Hyperglycemia promotes worse enteric infection outcomes independent of obesity. Finally, we showed that blocking of Wnt/β-catenin, lowering blood glucose, or restoring fluids improved enteric infection outcomes in hyperglycemic mice.",2025,"['t', '##lr4', 'akita', 'akita', '##inal wnt / β - catenin', 'wnt / β - catenin', 'wnt', 'β - catenin', 'wnt / β - catenin']",['wnt']
Synthetic Mimics of Wound-Induced Carrot MicroRNAs Affect Lipid Metabolism in Cultured Adipocytes.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Plant-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as cross-kingdom regulatory molecules, but their capacity to influence mammalian metabolism is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether miRNAs induced in carrots (<i>Daucus carota</i>) by postharvest wounding stress can modulate adipocyte lipid accumulation. <b>Methods:</b> High-throughput small RNA sequencing was performed to identify stress-responsive miRNAs in wounded carrots. Bioinformatic analyses predicted potential mammalian targets, focusing on genes involved in adipogenesis and lipid regulation, including those in the insulin and FoxO signaling pathways. Selected miRNAs were functionally validated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by assessing intracellular triglyceride levels and glycerol release. <b>Results:</b> Six stress-responsive carrot miRNAs were predicted to target mammalian lipid metabolism genes. Functional assays revealed that miR165a-3p, miR232a-5p, and miR1799 significantly decreased intracellular triglyceride accumulation and increased glycerol release, suggesting enhanced lipolysis. These effects support the potential regulation of adipocyte metabolism through plant miRNA mimics. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings provide experimental evidence for stress-induced carrot miRNAs mimics potentially modulate fat accumulation.

Phenotypic Switch of Adipose Tissue Macrophages as a Target to Reduce Obesity-Associated Metabolic Risk,"Obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease, is caused by a positive balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Adipose tissue (AT) inflammation is the main cause of local and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress and is the link between systemic inflammation and obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), fatty liver disease, and dysfunction of pancreatic &beta;-cells. AT macrophages are derived from bone marrow and blood monocytes that, upon arrival and under the pressure of the AT microenvironment, are differentiated into AT-associated macrophages (ATMs). The AT microenvironment in obesity causes the activation of transcription factors that control the expression of a number of inflammatory genes, leading to an ATM M1 phenotype or classically activated ATM. These M1 macrophages express a number of proinflammatory genes and are the main cause of AT inflammation. Herein, we reviewed recently published information on the molecular mechanisms leading to the phenotypic switch of macrophages under the pressure of obese AT. This information is needed to develop novel mechanism-based therapeutics to reduce AT inflammation and thus the metabolic risk associated with obesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'atm m1']",['insulin']
Creating an adolescent intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment for type 1 diabetes: Feedback from the target population.,"<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of obesity among youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has significantly increased over the past few decades, leading to increased risks for morbidity and early mortality.

Non-hematopoietic roles of erythropoietin in inflammation and metabolic disorders.,"Erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone primarily produced by the kidneys, is essential for erythropoiesis. Beyond its well-established hematopoietic function, EPO has emerged as a regulator of metabolic inflammation. Obesity-induced chronic inflammation underlies insulin resistance, a key driver of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Recent evidence shows EPO exerts anti-inflammatory effects in insulin-sensitive tissues, thereby improving insulin sensitivity in the context of obesity. Although EPO is clinically approved for treating anemia in both neonates and adults, further evaluation is needed to establish its safety and tolerability when repurposed for metabolic indications across these populations. Nevertheless, to overcome the hematopoietic side effects of native EPO, researchers have developed non-hematopoietic analogs with selective tissue-protective actions. These analogs are currently under investigation and have shown therapeutic potential without erythropoietic side effects.

Investigating shared genetic architecture between major depressive disorder and central obesity.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigated the shared genetic architecture between major depressive disorder (MDD) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) to provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying their comorbidity.<h4>Methods</h4>Using large-scale genome-wide association study summary statistics, we performed cross-trait genetic correlation and pleiotropic variant discovery analyses and bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis, as well as drug target prioritization analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We identified significant genetic correlation between MDD and WHR (r <sub>g</sub> = 0.11, p = 4.18 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). Cross-trait analysis identified 26 pleiotropic loci, including a novel variant (rs2855812, intronic to MICB). Colocalization analysis confirmed six pleiotropic loci. Forward Mendelian randomization analysis demonstrated MDD is associated with increased WHR (β = 0.079, 95% CI: 0.014-0.143; p = 0.017), with no reverse causation. Drug prioritization identified agents able to be repurposed targeting MICB, PSORS1C1, and C6orf15. Enrichment analyses highlighted immune pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings establish pleiotropy between MDD and WHR, implicating dysregulated immunometabolic pathways as shared mechanisms. Prioritized drug targets represent translatable opportunities for comorbidity management.",2025,"['micb', 'ps', '##ors1c1', 'c6orf15']","['micb', 'c6orf15']"
Triple Agonism Based Therapies for Obesity.,"<h4>Purpose of the review</h4>Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RA) have transformed obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) management. Tirzepatide, the first dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RA approved for both conditions, has paved the way for next-generation incretin-based therapies. Among these, triple agonists targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors represent a promising next step. This review outlines the rationale for their development and summarizes clinical trial data, focusing on retatrutide, the most advanced candidate.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Retatrutide is the first triple agonist (acting on GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptors) with published phase 2 data in people with obesity as well as in people with T2D. Retatrutide achieved up to 24.2% mean weight loss after 48 weeks in individuals with obesity and 16.9% in those with T2D after 36 weeks. In the T2D study, HbA1c improved by 2.2%, with 82% of participants reaching HbA1c ≤ 6.5%. Retatrutide also improved multiple cardiometabolic parameters, including blood pressure, lipids, waist circumference, and liver fat (82% reduction in hepatic steatosis). Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common side effects; no major safety concerns were observed. A comprehensive phase 3 program is ongoing to evaluate efficacy, safety, and cardiovascular/renal outcomes in people with obesity and/or T2D. Other unimolecular triple agonists and combination regimens involving tirzepatide with additional mono agonists are also in development.<h4>Summary</h4>Retatrutide, a triple agonist now in phase 3 trials, has the potential to become the most effective pharmacological treatment for obesity while also offering substantial benefits in T2D management and other cardiometabolic risk factors.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'glp - 1', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypept', 'incretin', 'glp - 1', 'gip', 'glucagon receptors', 'glp - 1', 'gip', 'glucagon receptors', 'hba1c', 'h']","['glp 1', 'incretin', 'gip', 'glucagon receptor', 'hba1c']"
Cholinergic network modulation in disinhibited eating behavior.,"Cholinergic modulation of brain reward circuitry appears to play a crucial role in information processing about salience as a key biological mechanism in obesity. However, changes in acetylcholine transmission leading to abnormal eating behavior have not been demonstrated in vivo in human obesity. Using simultaneous positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found an increased α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) availability in response to visually salient food cues in twenty individuals with obesity, particularly in those with high disinhibited eating behavior, whereas there was no change in sixteen volunteers served as normal weight control. This increase was accompanied by a shift from dorsal attention network activation in normal-weight controls to salience network activation in individuals with obesity indicating fundamental differences in sensory cue detection. These data should encourage further investigations into α4β2* nAChR in obesity, particularly with regard to treatment with nicotinic receptor agonists for weight loss targeting hedonic overeating.",2025,"['α4β2 * nicotinic acetylcholine receptors', 'nachr', 'α4β2 * nachr', 'nicotinic receptor']","['nachr', 'nicotinic receptor']"
Therapeutic potential of five frequently prescribed herbs in obesity-associated Hashimoto's thyroiditis: insights from efferocytosis regulation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patients with obesity-associated Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) have been prevalent in clinical practice. Obesity is a risk factor for HT as it promotes pro-inflammatory processes and influences the balance of immune cell subsets. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is characterized by its multi-component and multi-target approach and shows potential in treating HT. Specifically, TCM can reduce thyroid antibody levels and alleviate clinical symptoms without impairing thyroid function. Moreover, TCM offers significant benefits in regulating lipid metabolism and decreasing systemic inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>Targets of five high-frequency herbs (<i>Hedysarum multijugum</i> Maxim, Radix Bupleuri, <i>Prunella vulgaris</i>, <i>Fritillaria thunbergii</i> Bulbus, and <i>Angelicae sinensis</i> Radix) were obtained from the TCMSP and Swiss Target Prediction databases. Targets associated with obesity-associated HT were collected from the GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases. Subsequently, we employed KEGG signaling pathway enrichment and GO biological process enrichment analyses to investigate the potential mechanisms by which the active ingredients of these herbs treat obesity-associated HT. Then, STRING database networks and Cytoscape software were used to construct the protein-protein interaction network and screen for key targets. Finally, molecular docking was performed to predict the binding interactions between the targets.<h4>Results</h4>Efferocytosis emerged as the key mechanism in the context of five herbs and obesity-associated HT. Quercetin was identified as the primary active ingredient responsible for efferocytosis, and it bound well with efferocytosis-related targets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study's key finding is that five high-frequency prescribed herbs may treat obesity-associated HT through efferocytosis. This provides new evidence to support the use of TCM in treating obesity-associated HT.",2025,['k'],[]
Molecular Signatures of Obesity-Associated Infertility in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: The Emerging Role of Exosomal microRNAs and Non-Coding RNAs.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic conditions affecting women of reproductive age. This condition affects around 20% of this demographic and is characterized by polycystic ovarian morphology, hyperandrogenism, and chronic anovulation. Obesity, impacting 40-85% of women with PCOS, exacerbates insulin resistance, increases insulin levels, and intensifies low-grade inflammation. This exacerbates the reproductive and metabolic complications associated with the condition. Recent advancements in molecular biology have underscored the significance of non-coding RNAs, including as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), as crucial regulators of gene expression and prospective biomarkers for PCOS. Exosome-derived microRNAs (ex-miRNAs) have emerged as compelling candidates due to their stability in body fluids and their capacity to promote intercellular communication among adipose tissue, the ovary, and the endometrium. Research, encompassing both experimental and clinical studies, has shown that ex-miRNAs display differing expression levels in women with obesity-related PCOS. Several of these ex-miRNAs are associated with networks that govern inflammation, glucose metabolism, steroidogenesis, and folliculogenesis. Moreover, the encapsulation of these chemicals within exosomes safeguards them from enzymatic breakdown, hence augmenting their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Despite the initial results being encouraging, challenges remain in standardising exosome separation, quantifying miRNA, and analyzing functional data within the complex pathophysiology of PCOS. This narrative review consolidates existing evidence regarding the molecular signatures of obesity-related infertility in PCOS, emphasising the growing significance of exosomal miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs, while examining their translational potential for early diagnosis and personalised therapeutic approaches.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Extracellular vesicle miRNA signatures in pediatric onset-multiple sclerosis and obesity-driven immune and metabolic dysregulation,"<h4>Background</h4>  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating autoimmune syndrome of the central nervous system (CNS). The cause of MS remains unknown; however, a dysregulated metabolome appears to play a contributing role. Up to 10% of all MS cases occur in childhood or adolescence. Childhood obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of MS. Pediatric-onset MS (POMS) provides a unique opportunity to study obesity-associated autoimmunity in the absence of age-related comorbidities. Circulating extracellular vesicle-encapsulated microRNAs (EV-miRNAs) have emerged as stable biomarkers and regulators of immune and metabolic pathways in neuroinflammatory disorders but have not been investigated in POMS. <h4>Methods</h4>  We performed bulk and single EV analysis on platelet-poor plasma EVs from children with POMS and age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. EVs were isolated via tangential flow titration (TFF) and subjected to miRNA-Seq. Differential expression analyses were performed to identify EV-miRNAs unique to MS and obesity. Functional enrichment was employed to elucidate impacted biological pathways. Key findings were cross-referenced with known and published pathways. Single EV analysis using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) was employed to identify EV and obesity-specific markers at single-particle resolution. <h4>Results</h4>  Bulk EV characterization confirmed the presence of small EVs with classic biophysical characteristics. Particle size was comparable across both groups and ranged between 70 to 91 nm and concentration range was 2 x 10 10 to 1 x 10 11 / mL. EV-miRNA sequencing demonstrated marked global differential transcriptomics between POMS and controls, irrespective of BMI. Notably, we identified MS-enriched EV-miRNAs, such as miR-29b-3p, miR-4326, miR-671-3p, and miR-139-3p, that are involved in cholesterol homeostasis, inflammatory signaling, T-cell regulation and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity. These MS-specific alterations implicate EV-miRNA cargo in modulating pathobiologically relevant pathways, such as immune regulation, neuroinflammation, and lipid metabolism. Obesity also had a pronounced, group-specific impact on EV-miRNAs. Subgroup analysis comparing controls to obese POMS revealed alterations in EV-miRNAs involved in regulating metabolism homeostasis, pro-adipogenesis and inflammation (e.g., miR-29a-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-29c-3p, miR-27a-3p). In POMS patients, obesity further amplified these trends with markedly increased pathogenic EV-miRNAs, including miR-142-5p, miR-29a-3p, and let-7d-5p, and significant suppression of protective EV-miRNAs, such as miR-30d-5p, let-7c-5p, and miR-151a-5p when comparing normal weight MS versus obese MS. Enrichment analysis revealed dysregulated EV-miRNAs in MS target pathways central to immune activation, neuroinflammation, and lipid metabolism, while obesity accentuated disturbances in pathways, for example AMPK signaling, insulin resistance, and axon guidance. Single EV analysis via TIRFM confirmed the presence of obesity-specific EVs within the circulating plasma EV pool of POMS. <h4>Conclusion</h4>  EV-miRNA profiles differ significantly between POMS patients and controls, reflecting aberrant immune and metabolic regulation in disease. Furthermore, obesity resulted in an expanded MS-related, EV-miRNA dysregulated repertoire, underscoring a prospectively novel cellular mechanism underlying obesity-associated CNS autoimmunity. These findings highlight plasma EVs as promising minimally invasive biomarkers in POMS and provide novel therapeutic candidates for future validation in larger cohorts.",2025,"['mir - 29b - 3p', 'mir - 4326', 'mir - 671 - 3p', 'mir - 139 - 3p', 'mir - 29a - 3p', 'mir - 142 - 5p', 'mir - 29c - 3p', 'mir - 27a - 3p', 'mir - 142 - 5p', 'mir - 29a - 3p', 'let - 7d - 5p', 'mir - 30d - 5p', 'let - 7c - 5p', 'mir - 151a - 5p', 'am', '##pk', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Mechanisms of cognitive impairment in arterial hypertension.,"Cognitive impairment in elderly patients with arterial hypertension is an urgent medical and social problem. This is especially important given the high prevalence of arterial hypertension. In this regard, the mechanisms of cognitive impairment are of growing interest in order to find new preventive and therapeutic strategies. In general, the main mechanisms determining the association between hypertension and cognitive impairment include imbalances in cerebral blood flow perfusion, immune and metabolic disorders, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and brain structure abnormalities. Metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance in the brain, are of growing interest as mechanisms of cognitive impairment. Comorbid diseases and target organ damage, which are common in arterial hypertension, also play an important role.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Saving muscle while losing weight: A vital strategy for sustainable results while on glucagon-like peptide-1 related drugs.,"Obesity affects over 1 billion people worldwide and is linked to more than 230 health complications, with cardiovascular disease being a leading cause of mortality. Losing 5%-10% of body weight is considered clinically significant for improving health. This weight loss can be achieved through pharmacotherapy, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide dual receptor agonists, and GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon triple receptor agonists (such as semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide, respectively). While much of the weight loss comes from fat mass, these treatments also result in the loss of lean mass, including muscle. This loss of muscle may contribute to difficulties in maintaining weight over the long term and can lead to sarcopenia. Therefore, the focus of new anti-obesity treatments should be primarily on reducing fat mass while minimizing the loss of muscle mass, ideally promoting muscle gain. Research focusing on human myocytes has identified more than 600 myokines associated with muscle contraction, which may play a crucial role in preserving both muscle mass and function. We explored the potential of new anti-obesity agents and their combinations with incretin-based therapies to achieve these outcomes. Further studies are needed to better understand the functional implications of lean mass expansion during weight loss and weight maintenance programs.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'glp - 1', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'glp - 1', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'glucagon', 'incre']","['glp 1', 'glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'glucagon']"
"Effects of Chlorella vulgaris, Microchloropsis Gaditana and Gracilaria vermiculophylla algae extracts on maturing and mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.","The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, and it is a risk factor for various metabolic disorders. White adipose tissue expansion depends on hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes, thus the search for new tools that target these two processes is relevant for the prevention and treatment of obesity. Algae are an interesting source of bioactive compounds and have been demonstrated to exert beneficial health effects. Therefore, this study aims at analysing the effects on adipogenesis and triglyceride accumulation of peptide- and protein-rich extracts obtained from the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris and Microchloropsis gaditana and the macroalga Gracilaria vermiculophylla. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and mature adipocytes were incubated with each of the extracts at 10, 25, 50 and 150 µg/mL. The extracts were found to reduce triglyceride content in maturing pre-adipocytes, without cytotoxic effects. Although, in all cases, it seems that the extracts cannot act throughout the whole adipogenic process, they are effective in suppressing pre-adipocyte differentiation, to a greater or lesser extent. This effect is most likely mediated mainly by the transcription factor C/EBPα. Under our experimental conditions, the extracts used in the present study are effective in inhibiting adipogenesis but they are not able to reduce triglyceride accumulation in mature adipocytes.",2025,['c / ebpα'],[]
Strategies to improve recruitment to multicomponent group programs for overweight and obesity: a systematic review.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Multicomponent programs are recommended for the treatment of children, adolescents, and adults with overweight or obesity. However, program providers often face difficulties reaching their target groups. This systematic review aimed at identifying recruitment strategies for multicomponent overweight and obesity programs in group settings and at summarizing barriers and facilitators for participation.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Web of Science) and included primary studies reporting on recruitment strategies for multicomponent group programs for children, adolescents, and adults with overweight or obesity. All study designs were eligible for inclusion. Study characteristics, recruitment strategies as well as barriers and facilitators were extracted from the included articles, summarized in a table format, and synthesized narratively.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 1,082 articles identified through the systematic literature search, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Eleven focused on children and adolescents, and five on adults. Recruitment strategies were categorized into active (e.g., referral by health professionals, direct contact) and passive methods (e.g., media advertising, flyers, posters). In most studies, a combination of several active and passive methods was applied or recommended. For socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, some targeted strategies were identified, e.g., recruitment in specific locations or through trained peers. Several possible barriers to recruitment were mentioned in the included studies, e.g., stigmatization, lack of time and resources of the healthcare staff, organizational barriers, lack of motivation of potential participants.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This systematic review identified several active and passive strategies for recruiting children, adolescents, and adults with overweight and obesity into multicomponent group programs. The overview of possible recruitment methods is a valuable decision support to be used by program providers when designing new or adapting existing programs.",2025,[],[]
Weight of time: exploring the link between obesity and aging.,"Obesity and aging are interrelated public health concerns, with growing prevalence, especially as global demographics shift toward an older population. This narrative review explores the mechanisms through which obesity accelerates the aging process, focusing on major aging pathways affected by obesity, including deregulated nutrient sensing, telomeres attrition, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. Evidence suggests that these disruptions not only drive age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative conditions, but also exacerbate mobility limitations, cognitive decline, and reduced quality of life in older adults. The role of lifestyle interventions, particularly adherence to the Mediterranean diet, is emphasized for its anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits, alongside strategies to address the social and psychological impacts of obesity on aging. By recognizing obesity as a significant modifiable risk factor for accelerated aging, this review advocates comprehensive and targeted interventions to promote healthier aging and improve quality of life in older populations globally.",2025,[],[]
Effect of Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists on Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are approved for weight loss, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk reduction. Despite widespread use, GLP-1RAs have not been well studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the effects of GLP-1RAs on RA disease activity and cardiovascular risk profile in patients with RA and overweight or obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a retrospective chart review study of patients with RA with a body mass index of ≥27 who were prescribed a GLP-1RA (semaglutide or tirzepatide). Between 2018 and 2024, 173 patients with RA were identified in the treatment group (prescribed and took a GLP-1RA), and 42 patients with RA were identified in the control group (prescribed but did not take GLP-1RA). Patients were assessed at three-month intervals for up to one year after prescription. Outcome measures included RA disease activity, cardiovascular risk markers, and patient-reported outcomes. Changes in outcome measures within and between groups were assessed with linear mixed effect models, with adjustments for baseline characteristics that differed significantly between groups.<h4>Results</h4>GLP-1RA-treated patients experienced significantly greater reductions in RA disease activity, pain, body weight, total cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin than controls (P < 0.05). Within the treatment group, there were also significant reductions in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein values, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values, and triglyceride values (P < 0.05). Nearly one-third of the treatment group discontinued the GLP-1RA during the study period, with the most common adverse effect being gastrointestinal issues.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggests that the use of GLP-1RAs can improve RA disease activity and cardiovascular risk profile. Although further research is needed, this novel finding has significant clinical implications because it suggests that anti-obesity medications may improve both cardiovascular and RA outcomes.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ra', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'glp - 1ra', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'glycosylated hemoglobin', 'c - reactive protein', 'low - density lipoprotein cholester', 'glp - 1ra', 'glp - 1ras']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'glycosylated hemoglobin', 'c reactive protein']"
The Critical Role of the Bile Acid Receptor TGR5 in Energy Homeostasis: Insights into Physiology and Therapeutic Potential.,"Over the past decades, bile acids have been recognized as important signaling molecules with significant roles in metabolic health and disease. Many of their beneficial effects are mediated through the activation of the Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), a G protein-coupled receptor ubiquitously expressed in both humans and animals. Upon activation, TGR5 stimulates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates and activates several downstream signaling pathways, including exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and protein kinase B (AKT). Through these pathways, TGR5 acts as a key molecular link between bile acid signaling and the regulation of energy metabolism. TGR5 activation has been associated with body weight loss in obese models, primarily by reducing food intake, enhancing thermogenesis in adipose tissue and muscle to increase energy expenditure, and improving insulin secretion. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of TGR5 biology and critically examines its therapeutic potential, limitations, and controversies in the context of energy metabolism, offering new perspectives and opportunities for treating metabolic disorders.",2025,"['takeda g protein - coupled receptor 5', 'tgr5', 'g protein - coupled receptor', 'tgr5', 'adenylate cyclase', '##e', 'protein kinase a', 'pka', 'pka', 'exchange protein', 'epac', 'extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2', 'erk1 / 2', 'protein kinase b', 'a', '##kt', 'tgr5', 'tgr5', 'insulin', 'tgr5']","['tgr5', 'g protein coupled receptor', 'adenylate cyclase', 'protein kinase a', 'pka', 'epac', 'protein kinase b', 'insulin']"
Role of TRPV1 in neuroendocrine regulation: a potential target against obesity?,"Obesity is a common metabolic syndrome in which an imbalance between energy intake and consumption is the main cause of excessive accumulation of body fat. The increasing prevalence of obesity and its associated complications poses significant challenges to public health. Activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) cascade plays a key role in lipid metabolism and energy intake. TRPV1 is expressed across the central nervous system and peripheral organs is involved in the regulation of hormone secretion, appetite and mitochondrial function, and is recognized as one of the key targets for preventing obesity. The current treatments for obesity exhibit limited efficacy and are associated with numerous side effects. Targeting TRPV1 represents a potentially effective approach for managing obesity. In this work, by combining the recent mechanism of the role of TRPV1 in neuroendocrine regulation, we hope to provide novel approaches to block or even reverse the development of obesity.",2025,"['transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1', 'trpv1', 'trpv1', 'trpv1', 'trpv1']",['trpv1']
The Silent Surge: Obesity Driving a Global Cardiovascular Crisis.,"Recent global estimates indicate that more than one billion people live with obesity, a figure that has doubled since 1990. When overweight individuals are included, nearly 2.5 billion adults are affected, with high body mass index contributing to an estimated 1.9 million cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths annually. Obesity and its close association with CVD remain pressing public health challenges that require sustained, coordinated action. Recent global policy discussions, including the UN General Assembly's Zero Draft Political Declaration, highlight the importance of improving food labelling, taxing sugary drinks, limiting the marketing of unhealthy foods, and encouraging active living through supportive urban planning. Countries are encouraged to align national obesity strategies with the WHO's 2022 Acceleration Plan to STOP Obesity, with clear goals and mechanisms for accountability and monitoring. Preventive measures are most effective when introduced early, such as encouraging breastfeeding and creating supportive school environments that offer balanced meals, limit access to unhealthy foods, and incorporate regular physical activity into daily schedules. Fiscal measures, including taxes, subsidies, and mandatory nutrition labels, can help guide consumer choices towards healthier options. Supportive built environments with safe access to parks, pedestrian routes, and cycling paths further encourage active lifestyles. Health systems are central in ensuring equitable access to prevention and treatment, delivered through stigma-free and evidence-based care. Community-based and family-oriented programs have shown promise, while pharmacological options may complement lifestyle approaches where appropriate. Long-term progress depends on sustained commitment, cross-sectoral collaboration, and integration of obesity prevention into broader public health frameworks.",2025,[],[]
Effects of LIPOSA-T pharmacopuncture on localized fat as a fat dissolving injection via regulation of fat metabolism.,"<h4>Background</h4>Excessive fat deposition in localized adiposity is known to induce severe medical diseases as well as aesthetic problems. Of late, LIPOSA-T pharmacopuncture, a new herbal pharmacopuncture consisting of the cortex of <i>Morus alba</i> and bark of <i>Magnolia officinalis</i>, is developed as a non-surgical injection for dissolving localized fat deposits.<h4>Methods</h4>The network pharmacology analysis was carried out with the target gene sets of constituents of <i>M. alba</i> and <i>M. officinalis</i>. Male C57BL/6 J mice were induced obesity and injected LIPOSA-T pharmacopuncture into inguinal fat pad. The fat weight and size were analyzed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.<h4>Results</h4>The possible pathways and mechanism of action of LIPOSA-T were found to be mainly related to the fatty acid biosynthesis, glycolysis and glycogenesis in KEGG Pathways database. Subcutaneous injection of the LIPOSA-T pharmacopuncture significantly reduced the inguinal fat tissues weight and enlarged adipocyte size. In addition, the phosphorylated IRS with the PEPCK and G6p expressions were increased by the LIPOSA-T injection. Following the increase of AMPK expression, the fatty acid synthesis enzyme and lipolytic enzymes were regulated by the LIPOSA-T.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, LIPOSA-T exerted the catabolic effects on fat deposition in obesity by regulating the glucose production, lipid synthesis and TAG hydrolysis in consistent with the prediction results.

Saudi Healthcare Providers' Perspectives and Clinical Practice of Anti-Obesity Medications: A National Survey.,"<h4>Background</h4>The rising prevalence of obesity is associated with significant health risks, underscoring the need for effective prevention and treatment. The use of anti-obesity medications (AOMs) remains limited due to several barriers.<h4>Objectives</h4>To physicians' perspectives and clinical practices regarding AOMs in Saudi Arabia.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a national cross-sectional survey between May and August 2024 targeting family physicians, endocrinologists, and bariatric surgeons in Saudi Arabia. We distributed the survey using convenience sampling through department heads at hospitals across five regions and relevant professional societies. We collected data on clinician demographics, clinical practices, and perceptions related to AOMs. We compared responses across specialties and identified predictors of prescribing AOMs.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 92 clinicians completed the survey: 71 family physicians, 20 endocrinologists, and 1 bariatric surgeon. Overall, 15.3% of the respondents had received formal obesity-focused training. While 92.4% reported counseling patients on obesity-related complications, 57.6% routinely referred patients to dietitians. Endocrinologists preferred international guidelines and prescribed AOMs more frequently than family physicians (90.0% vs. 60.5%; <i>P</i> < 0.001). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were the most commonly prescribed first-line agents. Key predictors of prescribing AOMs included medical specialty, guidelines preference, and prior obesity training.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Physician specialty, clinical experience, and adherence to guidelines influence the prescription of anti-obesity medications in Saudi Arabia. Limited training and a more conservative approach among family physicians highlight the need for targeted educational interventions to improve obesity management.

Inhibition of lipolysis in visceral adipose tissue from obese mice and humans prevents impairment of endothelial Kir2.1 channels.,"Accumulation of abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction is a precursor to severe disease, and we and others have shown that arteries embedded in VAT, but not subcutaneous adipose tissue, exhibit robust endothelial dysfunction. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we recently linked VAT from obese mice to the impairment of endothelial Kir2.1, a critical regulator of endothelial function. However, the mechanism by which VAT impairs Kir2.1 is unclear. As Kir2.1 impairment is dependent on endothelial CD36, we hypothesized that lipolytic VAT induces Kir2.1 impairment through fatty acids (FA). To test this, we first treated endothelial cells with palmitic acid (PA) to determine whether the addition of exogenous FAs recapitulated our original finding of Kir2.1 dysfunction when challenged with VAT. PA inhibited Kir2.1 assessed via whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, an effect that was dependent on endothelial CD36. To determine whether inhibiting VAT lipolysis prevents Kir2.1 dysfunction in the presence of VAT in obese mice and humans, VAT was pretreated with small molecule inhibitors of adipose triglyceride lipase prior to incubating endothelial cells with adipose tissue. This approach also prevented VAT-induced impairment of endothelial Kir2.1 suggesting that VAT-derived FAs may play a role. Furthermore, inhibition of lipolysis in the VAT of obese mice and humans significantly reduced endothelial FA uptake, similar to that observed when CD36 was downregulated. These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between VAT and endothelial Kir2.1 impairment and place VAT-derived FAs as potential paracrine mediators.",2025,"['end', 'kir2. 1', 'kir2. 1', 'kir2. 1', 'endothelial cd36', 'kir2. 1', 'fas', 'kir2. 1', 'kir2. 1', 'endothelial cd36', 'kir2. 1', 'adipose triglyceride lipase', 'kir2. 1', 'vat - derived fas', 'cd36', 'kir2. 1', 'vat - derived fas']","['end', 'fas', 'adipose triglyceride lipase', 'cd36']"
Challenges and Perspectives in Treating Individuals With Musculoskeletal Disorders and Comorbidity: A Systematic Literature Review With a Descriptive Thematic Synthesis.,"<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of comorbidity amongst individuals seeking care for musculoskeletal disorders is rising. This underscores the importance of understanding how health care professionals are managing individuals with musculoskeletal disorders and comorbidity.<h4>Objectives</h4>To analyse the existing literature focusing on healthcare professionals' challenges and perspectives in managing individuals with musculoskeletal disorders and comorbidity.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive search was conducted across four databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and Scopus, focusing on healthcare professionals' experiences of treating individuals with musculoskeletal disorders and comorbidity. The review included studies of a qualitative nature that explored healthcare professionals' experiences in the management of this patient population.<h4>Results</h4>The systematic search yielded 2645 articles, of which five studies were included. All included studies investigated physiotherapists as their target group, while one study also included occupational therapists. Most studies focused on individuals with osteoarthritis and comorbidity. Common challenges identified included a lack of knowledge and training in addressing comorbidities in healthcare professionals, particularly psychological conditions, diabetes and obesity, which was perceived as a barrier for making individualised treatment plans.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic literature review highlights the limited evidence on the experiences of healthcare professionals in treating individuals with musculoskeletal disorders and comorbidity. Findings underscore the need for further training to support clinicians in treating this patient population, and the need for further research exploring the perspectives of healthcare professionals, especially among others than physiotherapists.",2025,[],[]
"Executive functioning difficulties in relation to food addiction, disordered eating attitudes, and metabolic syndrome markers among adolescents seeking obesity treatment: a cross-sectional analysis.","<h4>Background</h4>Executive functioning (EF) difficulties may play a significant role in the vicious cycle of overeating and metabolic disturbances. We aimed to investigate the correlates of EF difficulties in terms of food addiction symptoms, eating attitudes, and metabolic syndrome markers among adolescents seeking obesity treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirty-five adolescents seeking obesity treatment were included. Executive functioning difficulties were assessed using both performance tasks (i.e. Stroop's task and Cancellation task) and parent reports on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Other measurements included adolescent self-reports of food addiction symptoms on the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) and eating attitudes on the Eating Attitudes Test-40 (EAT-40).<h4>Results</h4>The mean total symptom score was 4.66 (± 1.45) on the YFAS. The most commonly endorsed symptoms were 'Repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease food consumption' in 94.3% (N = 32), 'Tolerance to the same amount of certain foods and consuming increasing amounts' in 80.0% (N = 28), and 'Continuing to eat despite knowing the negative consequences' in 77.1% (N = 27) of the sample. 48.6% of the adolescents with obesity (N = 17) met the criteria for diagnostic evaluation threshold according to YFAS, which was related to worse performance in Stroop Task and parent-reported difficulties in Emotional Control (p < .05 for both). Food addiction symptoms had differences in correlations with EF difficulties. ""Eating for longer durations and higher amounts than intended"" was related to difficulties in Emotional Control and Working Memory (p < .05 for both). ""Continuing to eat despite knowing the negative consequences"" was associated with difficulties in Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Plan/Organize, and Organization of Materials (p < .05 for all). Dieting was the only disordered eating attitude significantly correlated with EF difficulties. Specifically, less endorsement of dieting was correlated with difficulties in Inhibit and Working Memory (p < .05). Moreover, executive functioning difficulties were related to increased body mass index and waist circumference, in addition to worse metabolic parameters including fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and blood pressure measurements.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study points out that specific EF difficulties were related to food addiction symptoms, dieting, and metabolic syndrome markers among adolescents with obesity.

Antipsychotic-induced weight gain in psychosis – a causal mediation analysis and feasibility study of casual actionable prediction model development using counterfactuals to target obesity,"<p>Background: People with psychosis have a reduced life expectancy by 15 years, mainly due to preventable physical illnesses for which obesity is a precursor. Obesity is three times more common in psychosis and antipsychotics are an important cause. Prediction could individualise obesity treatment but current models are not fully actionable for individuals. <h4>Aims:</h4> We test whether antipsychotic-induced weight increase at 1 year is causally mediated by weight change in the first 12 weeks of treatment, rather than the following 40 weeks. We then develop and internally validate a causal actionable prediction pathway to prevent antipsychotic-induced obesity. <h4>Methods:</h4> We use parallel causal mediation analysis to determine the natural direct and indirect, and total effects of antipsychotic choice on weight in a trial of olanzapine versus haloperidol in 97 participants. We develop a baseline causal actionable prediction model to predict weight gain at 12 weeks in 172 participants, and a 12-week model to predict obesity at 1 year in 97 of the participants, and then demonstrate counterfactual prediction. <h4>Results:</h4> Antipsychotic-induced weight gain at 1 year appears to be causally mediated by weight change during the first 12 weeks treatment – indirect effect 5.70 (95% CI 2.83 to 8.66). At internal validation, the discrimination c-statistic for the baseline causal actionable prediction model was 0.732 and the calibration slope was 0.768. For the 12-week model, the c-statistic was 0.914 and the calibration slope was 0.601. We use the models to predict the counterfactual outcomes of antipsychotic choice and 12-week weight change. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Our study shows it may be early, rather than later weight change, which causally mediates antipsychotic-induced weight gain at 1 year. We also demonstrate the potential for causal prediction of counterfactuals targeting obesity for true precision medicine. Further research in larger samples is necessary before causal prediction models could be applied clinically.</p>",2025,[],[]
Ebastine-mediated destabilization of E3 ligase MKRN1 protects against metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a chronic condition encompassing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The heterogeneous and complex nature of MASLD complicates optimal drug development. Ebastine, an antihistamine, exhibits antitumor activity in various types of cancer. However, its effects on MASH remain unexplored. In the present study, we identified ebastine as a potential treatment for MASH. Our results indicated that ebastine acts as a novel MKRN1 inhibitor by promoting MKRN1 destabilization through self-ubiquitination, leading to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Ebastine appeared to bind to the C-terminal domain of MKRN1, particularly at residues R298 and K360. Notably, Mkrn1 knockout (KO) mice demonstrated resistance to MASH, including obesity, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis under high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFHFD) conditions. Additionally, liver-specific Mkrn1 knockdown using AAV8 alleviated MASH symptoms in HFHFD-fed mice, implicating MKRN1 as a potential therapeutic target. Consistent with these findings, treatment with ebastine significantly reduced the risk of MASH in HFHFD-fed mice, with a decrease in MKRN1 expression and an increase in AMPK activity. Our study suggests that ebastine binds to MKRN1, promoting its destabilization and subsequent degradation by stimulating its ubiquitination. This enhances AMPK stability and activity, suppressing lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. Moreover, the knockout of Mkrn1 mice decreased the risk of MASH, suggesting that ebastine could be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of MASH.",2025,"['##sh', 'mkrn1', 'mkrn1', 'amp - activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'mkrn1', 'mkrn1', 'mash', 'mkrn1', 'mash', 'mkrn1', 'mkrn1', 'ampk', 'mkrn1', 'ampk', 'mkrn1']","['mkrn1', 'amp activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'mash']"
Adipocyte exosome miR-4472 inhibits glucose uptake in skeletal muscle through downregulation of MEF2D.,"<h4>Aims/introduction</h4>Previous studies have found that miR-4472 is overexpressed in the serum of individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which may participate in the process of obesity-induced T2DM. However, a role for miR-4472 in the process has not been demonstrated. Here, we aim to investigate whether the increased content of miR-4472 in adipose tissue derived from exosomes inhibits glucose uptake in skeletal muscle by downregulating the expression of its target gene.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In vitro C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells, and in vivo diet-induced obesity mouse models and AT-Dicer KO mice were used to assess the impact of miR-4472 on glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. We also evaluated the effects of serum exosomes from normal and obese individuals on insulin sensitivity in mice and the expression of miR-4472 and target genes in skeletal muscle.<h4>Results</h4>miR-4472 exhibits a strong positive correlation with BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and FPG. The content of miR-4472 derived from adipose tissue exosomes increases in the circulation in a state of obesity, which can induce insulin resistance by targeting the expression of MEF2D/GLUT4, inhibiting the glucose consumption and uptake ability of skeletal muscle cells. Both exosome inhibitors and miR-4472 inhibitors can reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-4472 on MEF2D/GLUT4 expression and glucose intake and uptake ability. Additionally, they can improve insulin resistance caused by increased miR-4472 levels in mice with obesity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Adipocyte exosome miR-4472 inhibits glucose uptake in skeletal muscle through downregulating the expression of MEF2D/GLUT4.",2025,"['mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'insulin', 'mef2d', 'glut4', 'mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'mef2d', 'glut4', 'insulin', 'mir - 4472', 'mir - 4472', 'mef2d', 'glut4']","['insulin', 'mef2d', 'glut4']"

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; metabolism: physiological and pathophysiological implications.,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) is a critical coenzyme involved in cellular metabolism, energy balance, and various physiological processes. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in NAD⁺ synthesis, regulating the NAD⁺ regeneration pathway. This review summarizes the multiple roles of NAMPT in both physiological and pathological states, particularly in cellular stress, aging, metabolic disorders, and cancer. We first describe the central role of NAMPT in NAD⁺ synthesis and explore how NAD⁺ levels are regulated through NAMPT to control cellular functions and metabolic adaptation. Second, we analyze the pathological roles of NAMPT in aging and related diseases, highlighting how NAD⁺ depletion leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, and immune system dysregulation. Notably, NAMPT exacerbates cancer immune evasion mechanisms by influencing immune cell functions and the metabolic environment of tumors. We also discuss the potential of NAMPT as a therapeutic target, particularly through NAD⁺ precursor supplementation or the use of NAMPT activators and inhibitors to modulate NAD⁺ metabolism in aging, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Future research should focus on exploring the functional differences of NAMPT in various tissues and its therapeutic potential in disease treatment.",2025,"['nicotinamide ad', '##ne din', 'nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt', 'nampt']","['nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nampt']"
Understanding the pathophysiology of obesity-the relevance of weight loss strategies through behavior modification.,"Obesity is a chronic, progressive, and relapsing disease that can contribute to morbidity, reduced life expectancy, and adverse health outcomes. The prevalence of obesity increased worldwide in the past 60 years, mainly because of changes in our environment and society. With the technical revolution of the last century, new modes of transportation and working conditions, automatization, and computerization, human energy demands have decreased. In parallel, the availability of energy-dense food, refined carbohydrates, and fat has markedly increased. These developments in society clash with biological factors that predispose humans to the development of obesity. At the individual level, obesity is the result of a long-term imbalance between too much energy consumed and too little energy expended. Therefore, lifestyle and behavior interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure target the root causes of obesity. However, both at the individual and population level, obesity prevention and treatment strategies that are based only on behavior modification are frequently not successful in the long term. The limited effectiveness of behavior interventions on weight loss are explained by complex and persistent hormonal, metabolic, and neurochemical adaptations that prevent weight loss and promote weight regain. However, behavior interventions lead to important health benefits beyond weight loss and are therefore an integral part of obesity management. This review discusses how a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity can influence weight loss strategies through behavioral modification. The complex factors contributing to the development of obesity require a multimodal long-term approach that is based on behavior interventions but may also include pharmacological or surgical approaches. The treatment paradigm has recently shifted from simple weight loss strategies towards treating obesity as a multisystem disease.",2025,[],[]

Factors Associated With Physical Activity Levels Among Brazilian Military Law Enforcement Officers.,"<b>Background:</b> There is limited understanding of the factors associated with law enforcement officers' (LEOs') physical activity levels (PALs) in Latin America. This study aims to address this gap in knowledge. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey among military LEOs from a northern Brazilian state. An anonymous questionnaire, which assessed participants' PAL using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaires and quality of life (QoL) using the WHOQOL-BREF, was distributed to LEOs. We examined factors associated with PAL with the use of multiple linear regression models. <b>Results:</b> There were a total of 418 participants (38.6± 6.6 years old, 88.3% male). After adjusting for age, sex, role, rank, education, and QoL domains, each unit increase in body mass index (BMI) and the environmental QoL domain were associated with a mean decrease of 56.2 MET-min/week and an increase of 12.8 MET-min/week in PAL, respectively (both <i>P</i> < 0.05). Additionally, those with a college education or higher had a mean PAL increase of 381.1 MET-min/week compared to their counterparts (<i>P</i> = 0.005). <b>Conclusions</b>: Lower BMI, higher education, and improved environmental QoL are associated with increased PAL among Brazilian military LEOs.

"Unveiling CTRB2, RSPO3, KLOTB, and ROR1 as obesity-pancreatic disease association proteins: a comprehensive Mendelian randomization study.","<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is recognized as a prominent contributing factor for pancreatic diseases; however, the mechanisms remain elusive. We aimed to identify the mediating role of circulating proteins in these associations.<h4>Methods</h4>A two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to investigate associations between nine obesity indicators, thousands of circulating proteins, with three pancreatic diseases (acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcinoma). Colocalization analyses were performed to validate these associations. Protein mediating networks among obesity indicators and pancreatic diseases were investigated by mediation analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Genetically predicted circulating levels of 4, 2, and 2 proteins were associated with acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcinoma, respectively. In mediation analysis, decreased chymotrypsin B2 (CTRB2) levels mediated 1.03% (95% CI [confidence interval] 0.02%-2.03%) of the effects of body mass index on acute pancreatitis. Increased R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) levels mediated the effects of body mass index (2.95%, 95% CI 0.18%-5.73%), body fat percentage (4.53%, 95% CI 1.11%-7.96%), waist-hip ratio (8.48%, 95% CI 3.11%-13.86%), and visceral adipose tissue (3.93%, 95% CI 0.64%-7.22%) on acute pancreatitis. We also found increased klotho beta (KLOTB) levels mediated the effects of waist-hip ratio (7.01%, 95% CI 3.30%-10.71%) and visceral adipose tissue (8.98%, 95% CI 4.55%-13.41%) on chronic pancreatitis, and decreased receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) levels mediated the effects of body mass index (10.39%, 95% CI 3.36%-17.42%) and visceral adipose tissue (6.29%, 95% CI 1.00%-11.58%) on pancreatic carcinoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The MR suggests that circulating CTRB2, RSPO3, KLOTB, and ROR1 proteins may mediate associations between obesity and pancreatic diseases.",2025,"['chymotrypsin b2', 'ctrb2', 'r - spondin 3', 'rspo3', 'klotho beta', 'klotb', 'receptor tyrosine kinase - like orphan receptor 1', 'ror1', 'ctrb2', 'rspo3', 'klotb', 'ror1 proteins']","['ctrb2', 'rspo3', 'klotho beta', 'receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor 1', 'ror1']"
Recommender systems for obesity prevention: Scoping review of reviews.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Recommender systems are technology-based systems that generate recommendations or guide users to relevant information. This study is a scoping review aiming to describe what is known about the recommender systems for obesity prevention according to systematic reviews on this topic.<h4>Methods</h4>This scoping review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA ScR) guideline. Out of 148 records labeled as reviews in the database and online searches until October 2023, 10 reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria according to the Population, Concept, and Context framework: Population (human), Concept (recommender systems), and Context (obesity prevention). Bibliographic, population, concept, and context characteristics, and topics addressed in reviews were charted and synthesized using relative frequencies or described narratively. An overlap that occurs when the same primary studies are included in multiple reviews was assessed as the overall Corrected Covered Area (CCA: 0%-5% low overlap to ⩾15% very high overlap).<h4>Results</h4>The reviews were published between 2017 and 2023 and included 308 primary studies. The overlap in primary studies among the 10 reviews was low (CCA = 1.29%). The reviews described the recommender system properties (<i>n</i> = 8) or their implementation (<i>n</i> = 2) in any (<i>n</i> = 6) or specific populations (e.g., elderly; <i>n</i> = 4) and focused on nutrition (<i>n</i> = 9) and physical activity (<i>n</i> = 4) within obesity prevention context. The topics addressed in reviews were recommendation generation (i.e., technical system properties; <i>n</i> = 9), health content (e.g., nutritional advice; <i>n</i> = 7), and implementation (i.e., system evaluation and user application; <i>n</i> = 5). The evidence gaps included the need for new system development and evaluation (<i>n</i> = 8) and a focus on diverse health contexts (<i>n</i> = 4).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Evidence from past reviews suggests that despite the existence of several technical solutions, there is yet no consensus on how to generate the most accurate nutrition recommendations in the obesity prevention context. Future studies addressing system and user outcome evaluation are needed to identify the optimal parameters for any long-term behavior change in recommender system users.",2025,[],[]
"Associations of Total Dietary Quality Score, Dietary Behavior Adherence and Dietary Portion Adherence with Metabolic Factors Among People with Diabetes","<h4>Aims: </h4>: To examine whether adherence to dietary behaviors (DBA) and portion recommendations (DPA) after medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is associated with improved metabolic outcomes in individuals with diabetes. <h4>Methods:</h4> This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,002 adults with diabetes from 40 Diabetes Health Promotion Institutions (DHIP) in Taiwan. Registered dietitians assessed DBA and DPA, which were combined into a total dietary quality score (TDQS). Participants were categorized into tertiles: G1 (≤106.6), G2 (106.7–119.0), and G3 (≥119.1). Associations with metabolic outcomes were analyzed using correlation, ANOVA, logistic, and multiple linear regressions. <h4>Results:</h4> G3 participants had longer diabetes duration, lower BMI, waist circumference (WC), and abdominal obesity. They consumed fewer whole grains and oils, but more vegetables. The proportion achieving ABC targets was significantly higher in G3 than in G2 and G1 (15.9% vs. 14.7% vs. 14.4%), with the most notable difference observed in HbA1c target attainment. Each 1-point increase in the TDQS was associated with reductions in waist circumference (−0.119 cm), BMI (−0.044 kg/m²), HbA1c (−0.012%), and triglyceride levels (−0.883 mg/dL). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Higher dietary adherence was associated with better metabolic outcomes and ABC goal achievement.",2025,"['hba1c', 'hba1c']",['hba1c']
Retinoid X receptor γ interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ to promote browning during adipose tissue differentiation.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are global public health challenges. Activating thermogenic adipose tissues, such as brown adipose tissue and beige adipose tissue, could be a promising strategy to combat obesity and consequently obesity-related diabetes. Both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and retinoid X receptor γ (RXRγ) play significant roles in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation. However, the underlying mechanisms and interactions between these receptors during adipogenic differentiation remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a transcriptome sequencing dataset sourced from the GEO database, encompassing samples of white and brown adipose tissues from 15 healthy individuals. Our findings reveal that RXRγ expression is significantly elevated in brown adipose tissue relative to white adipose tissue (<i>p</i> = 0.041). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays validated that RXRγ can be co-precipitated with PPARγ. Subsequent luciferase assays demonstrated that the interaction between RXRγ and PPARγ significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) compared to the overexpression of PPARγ alone (3.4-fold vs. 1.5-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Notably, in human preadipocytes, the co-overexpression of RXRγ with PPARγ resulted in a significant increase in UCP1 transcriptional activity compared to the overexpression of PPARγ alone (3.4-fold vs. 2.0-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.05). In summary, our findings suggest that RXRγ serves as a novel cofactor for PPARγ, promoting the browning of adipose tissue through the upregulation of UCP1 transcription.",2025,"['peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - γ', 'pparγ', 'retinoid x receptor γ', 'rxrγ', 'rxrγ', 'rxrγ', 'pparγ', 'luciferase', 'rxrγ', 'pparγ', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'pparγ', 'rxrγ', 'pparγ', 'ucp1', 'pparγ', 'rxrγ', 'pparγ', 'ucp1']","['pparγ', 'retinoid x receptor gamma', 'rxrgamma', 'luciferase', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
Secreted phospholipase A2 regulates intercellular communications by coordinating extracellular phospholipid metabolism.,"Lipids play fundamental roles in life. In essence, ""phospholipase A2"" (PLA2) indicates a group of enzymes that release fatty acids and lysophospholipids by hydrolyzing the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. To date, more than 50 enzymes that possess PLA2 or related lipid-metabolizing activities have been identified in mammals and are subdivided into several families in terms of their structures, catalytic mechanisms, tissue/cellular localizations, and evolutionary relationships. Among the PLA2 superfamily, the secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) family contains 11 isoforms in mammals, each of which has unique substrate specificity and tissue/cellular distributions. Recent studies using gene-manipulated (knockout and/or transgenic) mice for a full set of sPLA2s have revealed their diverse roles in immunity, metabolism, and other biological events. Application of mass spectrometric lipidomics to these mice has allowed the identification of target substrates and products of individual sPLA2s in tissue microenvironments. In principle, sPLA2s hydrolyze extracellular phospholipids such as those in extracellular vesicles, microbes, lipoproteins, surfactants, and ingested foods, as well as phospholipids in the plasma membrane of activated or damaged cells, thereby exacerbating or ameliorating various diseases. The actions of sPLA2s are dependent on, or independent of, the generation of free fatty acids, lysophospholipids, or their metabolites (lipid mediators) according to pathophysiological contexts. In this review, I will make an overview of recent understanding of the unexplored immunoregulatory roles of sPLA2s and their underlying lipid pathways, especially focusing on their unique actions on extracellular vesicles, activated/damaged cells, and gut microbiota.",2025,"['"" phospholipase a2 ""', 'pla2', 'pla2', 'pla2 superfamily', 'pla2', 'spla2', 'spla2s', 'spla2s', 'spla2s', 'spla2s', 'spla2s']","['pla2', 'spla2', 'spla2s']"
"The MLL4: Roles in cell differentiation, adipogenesis and cancer.","Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays an important role in cellular biological processes. MLL4 (KMT2D), as a histone lysine methyltransferase, is responsible for the mono-, di- and tri- methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), and H3K4me1 at the super enhancer/enhancer or promoter regions usually couples with H3K27ac to promote the expression of many genes. The biology function of MLL4 in cell proliferation and adipogenesis has been widely reported. And silencing MLL4 prevent the development of obesity and fatty liver, making it a potential target. Furthermore, MLL4 is frequently mutated and loses the methyltransferase activity in multiple cancers. Dual functions of MLL4 in cancer have been reported due to the broad widely distribution of H3K4 in chromatin. The paradoxical function of MLL4 complicate it as the potential target of cancer therapy.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and obesity paradox in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with obesity, inflammation, and cardiac metabolism. While obesity contributes to HFpEF, the 'obesity paradox' suggests that higher BMI may correlate with better outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have cardiovascular benefits through weight loss, anti-inflammatory effects, and improved myocardial function. This systematic review involved randomized trials and cohort studies from 2015 to 2024, assessing GLP-1 RAs in patients with obese HFpEF (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). Outcomes included heart failure hospitalizations, mortality, exercise capacity, and quality of life. Eighteen studies involved over 22 000 participants. GLP-1 RAs, especially semaglutide and tirzepatide, consistently reduced weight, inflammation (C-reactive protein), and myocardial stress (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide) while improving 6-min walk distance and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores, uniformly across BMI groups. GLP-1 RAs counter the metabolic burden of obesity in HFpEF while preserving hemodynamic benefits, offering a promising therapeutic option.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'c - reactive protein', 'n - terminal pro b - type natriuretic peptide', 'glp - 1 ras']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'c reactive protein']"
Gustatory thresholds and obesity: a comparative study of five main tastes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is an important public health concern, which has dramatically grown in the last decades. Taste sensation determines food preferences and could contribute to obesity. Considering the conflicting results about the association of gustatory threshold and overweight/obesity status of individuals, this study designed to compare gustatory threshold of five main tastes (sweet, umami, salty, bitter, and sour) among individuals with overweight/obesity and with a normal BMI.<h4>Methods</h4>In this case-control and population-based study, 100 adults participated, divided into two equal number of normal and overweight/obese groups. To measure gustatory threshold of sweet, umami, salty, bitter, and sour tastes, solutions of sucrose, monosodium glutamate, sodium chloride, quinine hydrochloride and citric acid were prepared respectively. Three millimeters of each solution was dropped on the right side of the posterior tongue, and the same volume of distilled water was dropped on the left side. The concentration at which the participant perceived the taste was considered the gustatory threshold. The data was analyzed in SPSS software version 22 with the Mann-Whitney test and Spearmen correlation coefficient.<h4>Results</h4>No statistically significant differences were observed between the gustatory thresholds of the five main tastes among participants with normal BMI and with overweight/obesity. Moreover, among the numerical value of BMI and perceived concentrations of each of the tastes, no association was found (p value > 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>According to the findings obtained from this study, no significant statistical difference in gustatory threshold of five main tastes was observed among individuals with overweight/obesity and normal weight.",2025,[],[]
&lt;i&gt;Sargassum fusiforme&lt;/i&gt; Fucoidan Ameliorates Obesity-Associated Metabolic Dysfunction via a Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid-Mediated TGR5-cAMP-PKA Signaling Pathway.,"The global rise in obesity necessitates new therapeutic strategies. This study, for the first time, elucidates a novel indirect mechanism for the metabolic benefits of <i>Sargassum fusiforme</i> fucoidan (SFF). We found that SFF administration to obese (<i>ob/ob</i>) mice, while showing no direct effect on adipocytes <i>in vitro</i>, led to a significant 6.3-fold increase in serum tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). This SFF-induced TUDCA elevation was identified as the key mediator for improving systemic insulin resistance (IR) and white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation. Mechanistic studies revealed that TUDCA directly counteracted palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity in adipocytes by activating the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 5 (TGR5) and its downstream cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. This activation suppressed NF-κB-driven inflammation and inhibited pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid/linoleic acid (AA/LA) catabolism. Crucially, the <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic effects of SFF were phenocopied by direct TUDCA administration. These findings reveal a novel fucoidan-TUDCA-TGR5 axis, identifying TGR5 signaling as a promising therapeutic target for obesity-related metabolic diseases.",2025,"['insulin', 'g protein - coupled bile acid receptor 5', 'tgr5', 'camp - pka', 'nf - κb', 't', 'tgr5', 'tgr5']","['insulin', 'tgr5']"
The lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2B mediates microlipophagy to target obesity-related disorders.,"Lifestyle diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, are leading health problems, most of which are related to abnormal lipid metabolism. Lysosomes can degrade lipid droplets (LDs) via microautophagy, but the regulatory factors and physiological significance of this process are not fully understood. Here, we report the molecular mechanism and pathophysiological roles of microlipophagy, regulated by the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2B. Our study reveals that LAMP2B interacts with phosphatidic acid, facilitating lysosomal-LD interactions and enhancing lipid hydrolysis via microlipophagy depending on endosomal sorting complexes required for transport. Correlative light and electron microscopy demonstrates direct LD uptake into lysosomes at contact sites. Moreover, LAMP2B overexpression in mice prevents high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue inflammation; liver lipidomics analysis suggests enhanced triacylglycerol hydrolysis. Overall, the findings of this study elucidate the mechanism of microlipophagy, which could be promising for the treatment of obesity and related disorders.",2025,"['lysosomal membrane protein lamp2b', 'lamp2b', 'lamp2b', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Therapeutic potential of the gut commensal bacterium &lt;i&gt;Parabacteroides goldsteinii&lt;/i&gt; in human health and disease treatment.,"The gut microbiota, as a critical guardian of human health, maintains physiological homeostasis, modulating immunity, and facilitates nutrient metabolism. <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i>, a probiotic gut commensal, has garnered increasing scientific attention. This review systematically examines its biological characteristics, then analyzes mechanisms promoting health (immunomodulation, metabolic regulation, and intestinal barrier reinforcement), and finally evaluates disease associations (metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancies). Current evidence shows that therapeutic efficacy against obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autism spectrum disorder, and colorectal cancer via short-chain fatty acids secretion, bile acid transformation, and host immunity modulation. Dietary factors (e.g., inulin), pharmacological agents (e.g., metformin, aspirin), and lifestyle interventions (e.g., exercise synbiotics) dynamically regulate its abundance, underscoring therapeutic potential. Despite translational challenges-like optimizing cultivation, dose-response characterization, and genetic tool development-emerging applications (engineered probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and synthetic biology) highlight broad prospects. Future research should prioritize context-dependent mechanisms across diseases and refined translation strategies for microbiome-based precision medicine.",2025,[],[]
Cost-Utility Analysis of Metabolic Bariatric Surgery for Individuals with Obesity in Saudi Arabia.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) is an effective and relatively safe intervention for managing obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of MBS compared with the standard treatment-lifestyle modification plus liraglutide-in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).<h4>Methods</h4>A Markov model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes of MBS. Costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The analysis was conducted from societal and healthcare system perspectives, using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of one to three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. Direct medical and nonmedical costs were obtained from hospital records and patient surveys, respectively. Transitional probabilities and utility values were obtained from published literature and primary data collection in the KSA. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.<h4>Results</h4>Over a lifetime horizon, MBS yielded 0.38 incremental QALY and US$ 11,975 (Saudi Riyal [SAR] 44,905; purchasing power parity [PPP] 23,911) incremental costs, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 31,909 (SAR 119,660; PPP 63,717) per QALY gained from a societal perspective and US$ 36,353 (SAR 136,324); PPP 72,590) from a healthcare system perspective. The model was most sensitive to the discount rates of costs and outcomes and the direct medical costs associated with MBS. At a WTP threshold of one GDP per capita (US$ 30,436; SAR 114,135; PPP 60,775), the standard treatment had a 63% probability of being cost-effective. However, at a threshold of approximately 1.8 GDP per capita (US$ 56,000; SAR 210,000; PPP 111,821), MBS was cost-effective in 100% of the iterations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MBS is a cost-effective intervention compared with standard treatment in the context of the KSA. Efforts should be made to expand earlier and equitable access to MBS for individuals with a BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> without comorbidities across the country.",2025,[],[]
Effect of Metformin on the Risk of Post-coronavirus Disease 2019 Condition Among Individuals With Overweight or Obese: A Population-based Retrospective Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>A subgroup analysis of the COVID-OUT trial's long-term outcome found that starting metformin within 3 days of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis reduced post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) incidence by 63% in overweight or obese individuals. However, its generalizability remains uncertain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the effectiveness of metformin in preventing PCC in adults with overweight or obesity who had a recent COVID-19 infection.<h4>Design</h4>A retrospective cohort study using a sequential target trial emulation framework.<h4>Data sources</h4>The United Kingdom primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database from March 2020 to July 2023.<h4>Participants</h4>Adults with overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m²) and a record of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included. Exclusions included metformin use in the prior year or metformin contraindications.<h4>Measurements</h4>The outcome was PCC, defined by a PCC diagnostic code or at least 1 World Health Organization-listed symptoms between 90 and 365 days after diagnosis, with no prior history of the symptom within 180 days before infection. The pooled hazard ratio and risk difference for the incidence of PCC were adjust for baseline characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Among 624 308 patients, 2976 initiated metformin within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. The 1-year risk difference for PCC in the intention-to-treat analysis was -12.58% (hazard ratio 0.36; 95% CI, 0.32-0.41), with consistent results in subgroup analyses.<h4>Limitations</h4>Findings may not apply to individuals with a normal body mass index.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early metformin treatment in overweight or obese individuals may reduce PCC risk. Further research is needed to confirm causality and clarify metformin's role in PCC management.",2025,[],[]
UCP3 gene variants and obesity in a Pakistani sample population.,"Obesity is a growing public health challenge with complex causes involving both environmental and genetic factors. This study explored the contribution of genetic variants in the UCP3 gene (implicated in energy metabolism) to obesity risk in a Pakistani population. Using a case-control design, 400 participants from Karachi (200 cases-individuals with obesity; 200 controls-individuals with normal body mass index or BMI) were assessed for sociodemographic, obesity-related physical signs, comorbidities, anthropometric, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, alongside next-generation sequencing of the UCP3 gene. Individuals with obesity (cases) were more frequently married, had a family history of obesity, and exhibited obesity-related physical signs compared to controls. All anthropometric (except height) and metabolic (except HDL-C) variables were significantly aberrant in cases. Similarly, behavioral patterns such as random eating, a tendency toward fat-dense food, low physical activity, and irregular sleep-wake cycles were more prevalent among cases. Genetic analysis revealed 43 variants after quality filtering, with most located in regulatory regions rather than altering protein structure. Three variants, including rs35517703, rs142107918, and rs928421426, were observed exclusively in the individuals with obesity (cases). Additionally, three novel variants [73712770 (GA > GAA), 73718482 (CTTT > CTT), and 73718482 (CTTT > CTTTT)] were identified that may reflect population-specific genetic diversity. By focusing on UCP3 variants with population relevance, this research provides new insights into the genetic architecture of obesity in Pakistanis or South Asians in general. It supports the value of regional genetics and genomics studies in global health contexts.",2025,"['ucp3 gene', 'ucp3 gene', 'hdl - c', 'ucp3 variants']",[]
"Impact of Obesity on Metabolic Control in Type 2 Diabetes: Five-Year Trends of Turkish Nationwide Survey of Glycemic and Other Metabolic Parameters of Patients with Diabetes (TEMD Obesity Study, 2017-2022).","<h4>Introduction</h4>Türkiye has the highest obesity prevalence in Europe. Obesity not only causes type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but also impairs glycemic control in patients with T2DM. There is insufficient information about the demographic and clinical differences between individuals with T2DM who are living with or without obesity. The second TEMD survey across Türkiye investigated the latest overweight and obesity prevalence in patients with T2DM. The present study evaluated the 5-year changes in the prevalence, factors associated with an obesity diagnosis, and the association between obesity and metabolic control.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients under follow-up in tertiary units specialized for diabetes care were consecutively enrolled. The sociodemographic, anthropometric, and clinical variables were recorded. Metabolic targets were defined as hemoglobin A1c <7%, home arterial blood pressure <135/85 mm Hg, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100 mg/dL or <70 mg/dL or <55 mg/dL according to the risk factors or complications of patients. Metabolic target attainment rates were investigated across normal-weight, overweight, and obesity body mass index (BMI) classes.<h4>Results</h4>The TEMD Obesity Study enrolled 4,935 patients with T2DM (age 58.9 ± 10.1 years; women 59.8%). The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 33.4% and 55.1%, respectively. Obesity was more frequent in women with T2DM than men (66.2% vs. 38.1%; p ≤ 0.001). From 2017 to 2022, the obesity rate decreased from 59.0% to 55.1%, while the overweight rate increased from 31.0% to 33.4%. As BMI class increased, the achievement of three metabolic targets decreased while the incidence of microvascular complications rose. Significant associations were found between obesity and sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, education level) and lifestyle measures (diet, exercise, smoking) in multivariable logistic regression analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The TEMD Obesity study showed a decrease in obesity rates among patients with T2DM between 2017 and 2022. Also, the findings suggest that obesity poses an important barrier to the achievement of metabolic goals.",2025,"['hemoglobin a1c', 'low - density lipoprotein cholester']",['hemoglobin a1c']
A combined network pharmacology and experimental approach to investigate the mechanisms of curcumin on diabetes through the adipocytokine signaling pathway.,"The present investigation aims to establish the mechanism of curcumin in targeting diabetes and obesity, specifically through its effects on Adipoq, Il-6, and Tnf-α, using network pharmacology-based in silico analysis, followed by in silico validation. Target genes associated with diabetes and obesity were identified using GeneCards and SwissTargetPrediction, revealing that curcumin modulates Adipoq, Il-6, and Tnf-α within the adipocytokine signaling pathway, suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism. In this study, the effects of curcumin on diabetic rats were evaluated by assessing blood sugar levels (BSL), HbA1c, insulin levels, and adipocytokine expression. Diabetes was induced, and rats were treated with curcumin or pioglitazone for 4 weeks, followed by biochemical analysis. The in silico experimental findings demonstrate that curcumin is more effective than pioglitazone in managing obesity-induced diabetes by modulating the mRNA expression of adipocytokines. These results align with the predictions from in silico analysis, supporting the hypothesis that curcumin targets Adipoq, Il-6, and Tnf-α within the adipocytokine signaling pathway. This study introduces a targeted approach for diabetes management by modulating adipocytokines with curcumin. The integration of in silico analysis with in silico validation provides a comprehensive framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies against obesity-induced diabetes.",2025,"['il - 6', 'tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'tnf - α', 'hba1c', 'insulin', 'cu', '##umin', 'ad', '##o', 'il - 6', 'tnf - α']","['hba1c', 'insulin']"

The Role of miRNAs as Early Biomarkers in Obesity-Related Glomerulopathy: Implications for Early Detection and Treatment.,"Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) is a potentially reversible cause of kidney disease that often progresses silently until it reaches irreversible stages. However, we are still lacking a sensitive and specific biomarker to identify patients with obesity who are at risk of developing CKD. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has emerged as a promising area for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in kidney disease. Recent research has highlighted the specific roles of various miRNAs in renal function, showing that their dysregulation can contribute to the development of kidney diseases.

A scoping review on the use of a participatory approach in interventions to combat overweight and obesity in low socioeconomic status communities.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The burden of obesity on individuals and society has received much attention. However, most interventions to combat obesity as well as reviews focus on a (bio)medical approach. Applying an interdisciplinary approach that includes participation of the most heavily burdened low-socioeconomic status (SES) groups, are scarce. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify the characteristics and achievements of studies that applied a participatory approach to inform future development of interventions aiming to reduce obesity among low SES communities.<h4>Method</h4>We conducted a scoping review on interventions or initiatives aiming at obesity among groups with low-SES that apply a participatory approach, i.e. that involve the target population throughout the process.<h4>Results</h4>4246 papers were identified and screening of abstracts resulted in 37 eligible papers, resulting in 12 included papers after full-text screening. Among them, 9/12 derived from US; 7/12 were theory-based; 8/12 targeted individuals; 7/12 applied a CBPR protocol; 6/12 were participatory in the development, implementation, assessment, and evaluation phase; 4/12 applied an RCT for impact assessment and 1/12 used solely qualitative methods. 9/11 studies observed a reduction in weight/BMI.<h4>Discussion/conclusion</h4>Participatory approaches to inform and execute interventions to tackle obesity in low SES communities is an emerging approach.

Microglia/macrophage-specific deletion of TLR-4 protects against neural effects of diet-induced obesity in a sexually dimorphic manner.,"Obesity is associated with numerous adverse neural effects, including reduced neurogenesis, cognitive impairment, and increased risks for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Obesity is also characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation that is implicated in mediating negative consequences body-wide. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling from peripheral macrophages is implicated as an essential regulator of the systemic inflammatory effects of obesity. In the brain, obesity drives chronic neuroinflammation that involves microglial activation, however the contributions of microglia-derived TLR4 signaling to the consequences of obesity are poorly understood. To investigate this issue, we first generated mice that carry an inducible, microglia/macrophage-specific deletion of TLR4 that yields long-term TLR4 knockout only in brain indicating microglial specificity. Next, we analyzed the effects of microglia/macrophage TLR4 deletion on systemic and neural effects of a 16-week of exposure to control versus obesogenic high-fat diets. In male mice, TLR4 deletion generally yielded limited effects on diet-induced systemic metabolic dysfunction but significantly reduced neuroinflammation and impairments in neurogenesis and cognitive performance. In female mice maintained on obesogenic diet, TLR4 deletion partially protected against weight gain, adiposity, and metabolic impairments. Compared to males, females showed milder diet-induced neural consequences, against which TLR4 deletion was protective. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a central role of microglia/macrophage TLR4 signaling in mediating the neural effects of obesogenic diet and highlight sexual dimorphic responses to both diet and TLR4.",2025,"['toll - like receptor 4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4', 'microglia / macrophage tlr4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4', 'tlr4']","['toll like receptor 4', 'tlr4']"

Obesity reduces the urate-lowering efficacy among patients with primary gout: a prospective cohort study.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Obesity affects 53% of gout patients, while its effect on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is unclear. This study aimed to compare the response to febuxostat among different BMI catalogs of male gout patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective study recruited 633 men with gout, classified by BMI into normal-weight, overweight and obese groups. Baseline age, disease duration and serum urate (SU) levels were matched simultaneously. All participants received febuxostat for 12 weeks, increasing the dosage from 20 to 40 mg daily. We compared the efficacy of ULT and the incidence of gout flares in three groups. Cox regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for achieving target SU levels before and after matching. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were used to illustrate the relationship between BMI and hazard ratio (HR) for SU achievement.<h4>Results</h4>The proportion of participants achieving SU < 6.0 mg/dl in the obese group was 38.9%, significantly lower than the overweight (54.2%) and normal-weight groups (63.8%) (P < 0.05), with no significant difference between the overweight and normal-weight groups at week 12. High BMI (HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.96, P < 0.001) independently prevented achieving the SU target, with a similar effect after matching. Obese and overweight individuals had a higher cumulative incidence of gout flares compared with the normal-weight group (P < 0.05). The linear relationship between BMI and HR for achieving the SU target was suggested by RCS (nonlinear P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Obesity significantly reduces the efficacy of febuxostat-based ULT in male gout patients rather than being overweight.<h4>Trial registration</h4>China Clinical Trial Registry, #ChiCTR2300078804.",2025,[],[]

Targeting fatty acid-binding protein 4: A therapeutic intersection of obesity and cancer via lipid metabolism.,"Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) has emerged as a multifunctional regulator in cancer biology, linking dysregulated lipid metabolism, immune modulation, and tumor progression. Initially recognized for its role in fatty acid transport and lipid homeostasis, FABP4 is now understood as a secreted adipokine that influences diverse oncogenic processes, particularly in adipose-rich tumor microenvironments. It is upregulated in various cancers and secreted by both tumor and cancer-associated fibroblasts. FABP4 facilitates lipid transfer, promotes fatty acid oxidation, and reprograms cancer cell metabolism. It also contributes to the crosstalk between tumor-associated macrophages, T-cells, and dendritic cells. FABP4 also supports epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhances tumor cell plasticity, promotes invasion and metastasis, and has an impact on therapeutic resistance. The inhibition of FABP4 using small-molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies has shown promise in restoring therapeutic sensitivity and reducing metastasis in preclinical models. FABP4 has emerged as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker that predicts poor outcomes in multiple cancer types, supporting risk stratification and noninvasive diagnostics. Together, these findings place FABP4 at the intersection of tumor metabolism, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in precision oncology and personalized medicine.",2025,"['fatty acid - binding protein 4', 'fabp4', 'fabp4', 'fabp4', 'fabp4', 'fabp4', 'fabp4', 'fabp4']","['fatty acid binding protein 4', 'fabp4']"
The Interplay Between Oxidative Stress and Lipid Composition in Obesity-Induced Inflammation: Antioxidants as Therapeutic Agents in Metabolic Diseases.,"Adipose tissue functions not only as a lipid storage depot but also as an active endocrine organ that regulates key physiological processes. In obesity, oxidative stress disrupts the molecular pathways for adipose tissue homeostasis, triggering chronic inflammation, tissue dysfunction, and metabolic disorders. This review explores the mechanisms by which lipid storage drives adipose tissue expansion, highlighting the detrimental effects of hypertrophy in promoting oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance. These processes can ultimately contribute to metabolic pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. We also discuss how lipid composition influences these pathways, acting as signaling molecules that activate inflammatory and oxidative stress-related signaling cascades. Additionally, we compile evidence from studies on individuals with obesity, identifying lipids, oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory mediators as potential biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction. Finally, we assess the therapeutic potential of antioxidants in mitigating the metabolic effects of obesity, focusing on their mechanisms of actions. By integrating these insights, this review aims to clarify the complex relationship between oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and inflammation, and highlight the role of antioxidant molecules in addressing adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']

Impact of Maternal High-Fat Diet on Offspring Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Health: Spotlight on Oxidative Stress.,"Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKMS) encompasses interconnected cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders, including obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Oxidative stress is increasingly recognized as a central driver of this multi-organ dysfunction. Among maternal influences, exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy and lactation consistently predisposes offspring to CKMS-related phenotypes in animal models. While oxidative stress is implicated as a key mediator, its precise role in developmental programming remains unclear, and comparing the differences in its role between overt CKMS and CKM programming is critical. Critical gaps include whether oxidative stress acts uniformly or in an organ- and time-specific manner, which signals initiate long-term redox alterations, and whether these effects are reversible. Furthermore, its interactions with other programming pathways-such as renin-angiotensin system activation, epigenetic dysregulation, gut microbiota imbalance, and altered nutrient sensing-remain insufficiently explored. This review uniquely highlights maternal HFD-induced oxidative stress as a mechanistic axis of CKMS programming and delineates unresolved questions that limit translation. By integrating evidence across organ systems and proposing priorities for multi-organ profiling, refined models, and longitudinal human studies, we outline a forward-looking agenda for the field. Ultimately, clarifying how maternal HFD and oxidative stress shape offspring CKMS risk is essential to inform targeted antioxidant strategies to reduce the intergenerational transmission of CKMS risk.",2025,"['renin', 'angiotensin']","['renin', 'angiotensin']"

This study investigates the metabolic impact of GGE03 on lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and energy regulation in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD supplemented with GGE03 (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) for eight weeks. GGE03 significantly reduced body weight gain (HFD: 18.1 ± 0.3 g vs. HFD+GGE03 200 mg/kg/day: 13.4 ± 0.2 g, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and fat mass percentage (HFD: significantly higher vs. HFD+GGE03 50, 100, 200 mg/kg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Serum glucose levels were decreased from 220.2 ± 8.2 mg/dL (HFD) to 169.6 ± 5.9 mg/dL (HFD+GGE03 200 mg/kg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and triglyceride levels were reduced from 82.9 ± 4.2 mg/dL (HFD) to 57.2 ± 2.9 mg/dL (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR, was improved by up to 54.9% compared to the HFD (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Mechanistically, GGE03 administration increased AMPK phosphorylation (p-AMPK/AMPK ratio significantly elevated by HFD+GGE03 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and upregulated fatty acid oxidation gene expression (<i>Cpt-1</i>), while suppressing lipogenesis-related genes (<i>Srebp-1c</i>, <i>Fas</i>, and <i>Acc1</i>).

Crosstalk Between Skeletal Muscle and Proximal Connective Tissues in Lipid Dysregulation in Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) profoundly disrupt lipid metabolism within local microenvironments of skeletal muscle and its associated connective tissues, including adipose tissue, bone, and fascia. However, the role of local communication between skeletal muscle and its proximal connective tissues in propagating metabolic dysfunction is incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on these local metabolic interactions, highlighting novel insights and existing gaps. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a comprehensive literature analysis of primary research published in the last decade, sourced from PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. Studies were selected for relevance to skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, fascia, and bone lipid metabolism in the context of obesity and T2DM, with emphasis on molecular, cellular, and paracrine mechanisms of local crosstalk. Findings were organized into thematic sections addressing physiological regulation, pathological remodeling, and inter-organ signaling pathways. <b>Results:</b> Our synthesis reveals that local lipid dysregulation in obesity and T2DM involves altered fatty acid transporter dynamics, mitochondrial overload, fibro-adipogenic remodeling, and compartment-specific adipose tissue dysfunction. Crosstalk via myokines, adipokines, osteokines, bioactive lipids, and exosomal miRNAs integrates metabolic responses across these tissues, amplifying insulin resistance and lipotoxic stress. Emerging evidence highlights the underappreciated roles of fascia and marrow adipocytes in regional lipid handling. <b>Conclusions:</b> Collectively, these insights underscore the pivotal role of inter-tissue crosstalk among skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, bone, and fascia in orchestrating lipid-induced insulin resistance, and highlight the need for integrative strategies that target this multicompartmental network to mitigate metabolic dysfunction in obesity and T2DM.",2025,"['fatty acid transporter', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Comparative analysis of racial disparities between adolescents and adults undergoing bariatric surgery: analysis from the MBSAQIP database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metabolic surgery has emerged as a safe and efficacious treatment for adolescents and adults with obesity, although racial disparities exist in the bariatric population.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study analyzed patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes to determine if racial disparities differ across age groups in Black and White bariatric patients.<h4>Setting</h4>U.S. Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Initiative Program (MBSAQIP) data file.<h4>Methods</h4>Adolescents (≤19 years) and adults (>19 years) who underwent primary metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) from 2020-2022 were identified in the MBSAQIP data file. Patient characteristics and 30-day outcomes were compared by race and age group.<h4>Results</h4>Two thousand eight hundred twenty-nine adolescents (n = 793, 28% Black) and 434,775 adults (n = 102,973, 23.7% Black) were included. Preoperative median body mass index (BMI) was higher in Black versus White adolescents (48.6 versus 45.4, P < .001) and Black versus White adults (45.3 versus 43.3, P < .001). Co-morbidity burden was similar between Black and White adolescents. Compared to White adults, Black adults had higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency, P < .001. Black adolescents (7.1% versus 3.5%) and adults (4.1% versus 3.1%) were less likely to receive perioperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis versus White patients, P < .001. Incidence of postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) was higher in Black adolescents (.3% versus 0%, P = .02) and adults (.2% versus .09%, P < .001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Disparities exist for Black adolescents and adults undergoing MBS. While most outcomes were not clinically significantly worse in Black patients, ensuring appropriate VTE prophylaxis is an important modifiable target for improving outcomes.",2025,[],[]
GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Cancer Risk in Adults With Obesity.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely prescribed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes and have recently gained popularity for weight management. However, their long-term impact on cancer risk remains uncertain. Understanding this association is crucial for patient safety.<h4>Objective</h4>To compare the incidence of 14 cancers among adults with obesity prescribed GLP-1RAs vs nonusers.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This retrospective cohort study followed a target trial emulation design using 2014 to 2024 electronic health record data from OneFlorida+, a multicenter health research network that integrates real-world clinical data from diverse health care settings. Adults 18 years or older eligible for antiobesity medications without prior cancer history were included. Participants were categorized as GLP-1RA users or nonusers, matched 1:1 using propensity scores.<h4>Exposure</h4>Individuals taking vs not taking GLP-1RAs.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>The primary outcomes were the incidence of 14 cancer types, including 13 obesity-associated cancers (liver, thyroid, pancreatic, bladder, colorectal, kidney, breast, endometrial, meningioma, upper gastrointestinal, ovarian, multiple myeloma, and prostate) and lung cancer.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 86 632 matched adults (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [14.5] years; 68.2% female) were included, comprising 43 317 GLP-1RA users and 43 315 otherwise eligible nonusers. The incidence rates of the 14 cancers were 13.6 vs 16.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively, indicating a significantly lower overall cancer risk among individuals taking GLP-1RAs (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.76-0.91]; P = .002) compared with nonusers. In particular, taking GLP-1RAs was associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.57-0.99]; P = .05), ovarian cancer (HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29-0.96]; P = .04), and meningioma (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48-0.97]; P = .05). However, GLP-1RAs were associated with a marginally nonsignificant increased risk of kidney cancer (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.99-1.93]; P = .04).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This retrospective cohort study found that taking GLP-1RAs was associated with a reduced overall risk of cancer, including lower risks of endometrial, ovarian, and meningioma cancers, among patients with obesity or overweight. However, taking GLP-1RAs may be associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer, highlighting the need for longer-term follow-up to clarify the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these findings.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'glp - 1ras', 'g', '##lp - 1ra', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
Unraveling the Genetic Architecture of Obesity: A Path to Personalized Medicine.,"Obesity is a global health challenge characterized by significant heterogeneity in causes and treatment responses, complicating sustainable management. This narrative review explores the genomic architecture of obesity and its implications for personalized interventions, focusing on how genetic variations influence key biological pathways and treatment outcomes. A comprehensive literature search, guided by the authors' expertise, was conducted to identify key publications on the genomics of obesity and personalized approaches. The selection of articles prioritized those that provided direct insights into the genomic basis of obesity and its potential for informing tailored strategies. Genomic studies reveal both monogenic and polygenic influences on obesity, identifying numerous susceptibility loci. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have linked common variants in genes like <i>FTO</i> and <i>MC4R</i> to increased BMI and appetite dysregulation, respectively. Epigenetic research highlights the role of DNA methylation and other modifications in gene-environment interactions. Genetic and polygenic risk scores (GRSs and PRSs) show potential for refining risk stratification and predicting treatment response. The gut microbiome and metabolome also contribute to obesity pathogenesis, offering novel targets for intervention. Personalized medicine offers significant potential for improving obesity management through tailored interventions based on an individual's genetic and 'omics' profile. Future research should focus on elucidating the functional consequences of identified variants, exploring gene-environment interactions, and developing strategies to overcome current limitations in clinical translation. With continued advancements, precision medicine can enhance treatment efficacy, increase sustainability, and help reduce the global burden of obesity-related diseases.",2025,['mc4r'],['mc4r']
Expansion of a Pharmacokinetic Model for Diazepam to Characterize Real-World IV and Oral Data in Children With and Without Obesity.,"Diazepam is a benzodiazepine approved for use in adults and children. The label incorporates recommended dosing for status epilepticus in children. Published population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling recommends an intravenous bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg capped at 8 mg to reach the suggested target exposure of 200-600 ng/mL at 10 min post dose in children up to 17 years of age. This model was developed for children generally without obesity based on IV data, and it is unclear how increased body weight may affect exposure or target attainment given capped dosing. Diazepam concentrations after IV or oral administration for 61 children aged 2.5 to 20.6 years were used to externally evaluate the model including the addition of fixed oral absorption parameters. Then, PK parameters were re-estimated with the external population alone and again in combination with the original population. Re-estimated parameters from the combined population were used to simulate recommended dosing for children with and without obesity. The external dataset included 88 plasma concentrations from 61 children (54 with obesity) receiving diazepam per standard of care. The external evaluation resulted in 34.5% of predicted values within 30% of the observed concentration. Parameter re-estimation resulted in increased central volume of distribution (26% increase from a previous model), reduced peripheral volume of distribution and intercompartmental clearance, and similar clearance estimates. Simulations demonstrated that dosing caps may prevent children with obesity from reaching the suggested target exposure that is recommended for the treatment of status epilepticus. Further study is needed to evaluate the target exposure range in this population.",2025,[],[]
Identifying behaviour change techniques in school-based childhood obesity prevention interventions: a secondary analysis of a systematic review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood overweight and obesity is increasingly prevalent, can persist into adulthood, and lead to lifelong negative health trajectories. Schools are a recommended setting for childhood obesity prevention interventions; however, these interventions are often complex and multicomponent. While previous reviews have demonstrated their effectiveness, they have not identified which behaviour change techniques (BCTs - active ingredients of an intervention) are most effective.<h4>Objectives</h4>Describe BCTs used in healthy eating (HE) and physical activity (PA) intervention components of obesity prevention interventions supporting children aged 6-18 years; and explore which BCTs are associated with child weight.<h4>Methods</h4>A secondary analysis of school-based trials included in a 2022 update of a Cochrane systematic review was undertaken. The previous review included 195 randomised controlled trials of childhood obesity prevention interventions targeting HE and/or PA that assessed the body mass index of children aged 6-18 years. For this study, only trials delivered in schools that compared an intervention to a non-intervention control group and targeted HE, PA or both were eligible. Individual BCTs of each HE and PA intervention were coded according to the BCT taxonomy v1. Meta-regressions were conducted to determine the association between BCTs included in the trials and child weight.<h4>Results</h4>This secondary analysis included 124 eligible trials. Fifty-five of the 93 BCTs from 14 of the 16 BCT domains were identified across interventions. Interventions with a HE component that included BCTs from three domains (Goals and planning; Social support; Comparison of behaviour) were found to have a significant association with a positive effect on child weight, whereas there were no significant associations found for interventions with a PA component.<h4>Conclusion</h4>School-based obesity prevention interventions with HE components that included BCTs within the Goals and planning, Social support, and Comparison of behaviour domains, such as Goal setting (outcome), Social support (unspecified) and Demonstration of the behaviour were associated with a positive effect on child weight and should be considered for prioritisation in future interventions. Further research is required to identify effective BCTs for PA intervention components, and for effective individual BCTs and combinations of BCTs for all obesity prevention interventions broadly.<h4>Trial registration</h4>CRD42022366743.",2025,[],[]
Biopharma Evaluation of Anti-Obesity Vaccines in Global Trials by Dr. Slim™,"<h4>Background: </h4> The global obesity epidemic, marked by a doubling of adult obesity rates and a quadrupling among adolescents since 1990, necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies beyond lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. Anti-obesity vaccines represent a novel biopharmaceutical approach, aiming to achieve sustained weight management through targeted immunological mechanisms. While incretin-based therapies like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide) demonstrate significant efficacy, true anti-obesity vaccine candidates are in earlier developmental stages, targeting metabolic hormones (e.g., ghrelin, somatostatin) or infectious agents (e.g., Adenovirus 36). <h4>Methods:</h4> This literature review evaluates the current landscape of anti-obesity vaccine development, focusing on their mechanisms of action, preclinical and clinical trial progress, immunological considerations, regulatory challenges, and future prospects. Data were sourced from peer-reviewed articles (2014&ndash;2025) via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, emphasizing vaccine candidates targeting appetite-regulating hormones, adipose tissue, and infectious agents. <h4>Results:</h4> Anti-obesity vaccines are primarily in preclinical to Phase II stages, with candidates like ghrelin vaccines (e.g., CYT009-GhrQb) showing up to 15% reduced weight gain in preclinical models and modest clinical outcomes. Somatostatin vaccines (e.g., JH17, JH18) achieved 10&ndash;13% weight loss in mice, while Adenovirus 36 vaccines prevented fat accumulation in preclinical studies. Immunological challenges include suboptimal vaccine responses in obese individuals due to altered immune profiles, and regulatory hurdles demand long-term safety and efficacy data, with a minimum 5% sustained weight loss. Pharmacological agents dominate advanced trials, achieving 15&ndash;22% weight loss, setting a high efficacy benchmark. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Anti-obesity vaccines offer potential for cost-effective, long-term weight management but face significant immunological and regulatory challenges. Novel platforms (e.g., mRNA vaccines), multi-target strategies, and precision medicine approaches are critical for their successful translation. Rigorous, diverse clinical trials and long-term safety assessments are essential to compete with established pharmacotherapies and address the global obesity burden.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'ghrelin', 'somatostatin', 'ghrelin', 'g', 'somatostatin', 'anti']","['ghrelin', 'somatostatin']"
miR-10b-5p regulates adipocyte lineage commitment and adipogenesis via targeting of Gata6 and Tubby,"2 2.1 <h4>Background</h4>  Adipogenesis is a highly organised series of events that facilitates the healthy expansion of adipose tissue, beginning during embryogenesis and continuing throughout life. White adipogenesis protects against lipotoxicity, influencing insulin resistance and obesity-related comorbidities. Brown adipogenesis enhances energy expenditure, thereby counteracting weight gain, lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Recently, there has been a significant increase in interest regarding adipocyte differentiation, mainly focusing on the interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the transcriptional cascade that governs adipogenesis and metabolic dysfunction. This study aimed to identify miRNAs regulating white and brown adipocyte differentiation and define miRNA action in a stem cell model of adipogenesis. 2.2 <h4>Methods</h4>  Small RNAseq analysis of primary mouse brown and white adipocytes (WAs) identified miR-10b to be upregulated in mature brown adipocytes (BAs). We generated two model systems: 1) immortalized brown pre-adipocytes treated with miRNA inhibitors and 2) CRISPR/Cas9 KO of miR-10b in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Both cell models were differentiated into mature adipocytes. To unravel the pathways that are affected by miR-10b depletion, a transcriptomic analysis was performed at key time points. 2.3 <h4>Results</h4>  Both cell models showed that miR-10b-5p depletion severely impaired differentiation into mature adipocytes, as indicated by a lack of lipid droplet formation and reduced adipogenic gene expression. Gene expression analysis supports that miR-10b-5p directs embryonic stem (ES) cells towards the mesoderm lineage, promoting commitment to pre-adipocytes by downregulating Gata6 and its downstream target Bmp2. This mechanism appears to be unaffected in BAs. Our study demonstrated that miR-10b-5p regulates the later stages of adipogenesis, at least in part, by downregulating Tub, a direct target of miR-10b-5p. We also confirmed that miR-10b-5p alleviated the halted differentiation phenotypes of adipocytes by supressing the G Protein Signalling pathway mediated by Tubby. 2.4 <h4>Conclusions</h4>  These results evidence that miR-10b inhibition plays a dynamic role in adipocyte biology, as its inhibitory effects manifest differently during the stem cell preadipocyte proliferation state and during the maturation phase of adipocytes. Collectively, our study demonstrated that miR-10b-5p may represent a new potential therapeutic target for lipodystrophy and obesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'small rnaseq', 'mir - 10b', 'crispr', 'cas9', 'mir - 10b', 'mir - 10b', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'gata6', 'bmp2', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'tub', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'g protein', 'tub', 'mir - 10b', 'mir - 10b - 5p']","['insulin', 'crispr', 'gata6', 'bmp2', 'tub', 'g protein']"

Microbial Interactions with Intestinal Lipid Digestion and Absorption: Emerging Targets for Metabolic Disorders.,"Dietary fat undergoes digestion and absorption before entering enterocytes, where lipids are re-esterified and packaged into chylomicrons for lymphatic transport. The interaction between intestinal lipid absorption and metabolic disorders, such as obesity, has been demonstrated in both animal models and human studies. Here, we comprehensively review microbial interactions with intestinal lipase secretion and lipid absorption as well as the potential mechanisms associated with microbial metabolites, bile acids, immune cells, Snhg9, toll-like receptors, and intestinal permeability. We also highlight the relevance of these findings to metabolic diseases and their potential application in developing therapies that target intestinal lipid absorption through the modulation of gut microbiota, such as the use of probiotics and dietary nutrients. Finally, key questions regarding microbial interactions with intestinal lipid absorption are outlined to guide future research.",2025,"['##inal lipase', 'snhg9', 'toll - like receptors']","['snhg9', 'toll like receptors']"
Lipid-based nano-carriers for the delivery of anti-obesity natural compounds: advances in targeted delivery and precision therapeutics.,"Obesity is a major global health challenge, contributing to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. The increasing prevalence of obesity, driven by sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and genetic predisposition, underscores the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies. Conventional pharmacological treatments, including appetite suppressants and metabolic modulators, often fail to provide sustainable weight loss due to side effects, poor adherence, and limited long-term efficacy. As a result, natural bioactive compounds have gained attention for their anti-obesity potential. However, their clinical application is hindered by poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and inefficient delivery. Lipid-based nano-carriers, including liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, offer a promising solution by enhancing the solubility, stability, and targeted delivery of these compounds. These advanced delivery systems improve bioactive retention, enable controlled release, and enhance therapeutic action on adipose tissue and metabolic pathways. Additionally, functionalized and stimulus-responsive nanocarriers present innovative approaches for precision obesity treatment. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in large-scale production, regulatory approval, and long-term safety. Overcoming these barriers is critical to ensuring the successful clinical translation of nano-formulated therapies. This review explores the potential of lipid-based nano-carriers in optimizing the therapeutic efficacy of natural anti-obesity compounds and highlights their role in advancing next-generation obesity management strategies.",2025,[],[]

Obesity induced transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle across different species.,"Pigs on high-fat diets maintaining metabolic homeostasis and are resistant to hepatic steatosis, differing from humans and mice. Obesity-induced metabolic dysregulation and inflammation in skeletal muscle are well-studied in humans and mice, but less is known about pig skeletal muscle responses. This study constructs the skeletal muscle transcriptome of obese pigs and integrates it with publicly available transcriptional profiles from obese humans and mice, and ATAC-seq data from lean individuals across species. We systematically characterized transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle under stress of obesity, focusing on the evolution of gene families, orthologous genes, and epigenetic regulation. Our results show that obesity activates lipid catabolism genes and inhibits immune response genes in pig skeletal muscle, contrasting with humans and mice. We identify expanding gene families in pigs, such as olfactory receptors, α-amylase, and ABC transporters, which are upregulated in obesity. While oxidative metabolism-related gene families are contracted in the human and mouse genomes and are downregulated with obesity. By comparing orthologous genes, we identify a set of divergently changing genes induced by obesity across species, which primarily participate in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and immune cell activation. High-divergence genes show conserved coding and promoter sequences, and exhibit greater chromatin accessibility in promoter regions, compare with low-divergence genes. These findings suggest that gene dosage and transcriptional plasticity contribute to species-specific expression divergent responses to obesity. Identifying rapidly evolving gene families, divergently expressed genes, and potential transcription factor binding sites may reveal new insights into obesity-related metabolic disorders and therapeutic targets.",2025,"['α - amylase', 'abc transporters']",['abc transporter']
Key components of effective non-pharmacological interventions for childhood obesity: a review considering social determinants of health.,"Childhood obesity, driven by an obesogenic environment, remains a public health priority. To review the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for treating childhood obesity, with a focus on weight reduction and consideration of social determinants of health (SDOH). The review included randomized and quasi-experimental studies, published between August 2016 and December 2021, that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing body weight in children aged 2 to 14 years with obesity. (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022301191). A total of 59 interventions were identified, showing wide variability in design, duration, components and settings. Most included physical activity (93%) and nutrition (81%), while fewer incorporated psychological support (46%) or digital tools (25%). Despite the diversity of approaches, 56% of the interventions were effective, particularly those implemented in healthcare or school settings, involving physical activity, and delivered by multidisciplinary teams. However, only six demonstrated sustained effects beyond 6 months. Risk of bias was high in over half of the studies, and only a small proportion (22%) reported participants' social characteristics such as family structure, race, or socioeconomic status. Importantly, very few interventions were designed or evaluated with explicit consideration of SDOH.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, effective interventions tended to target both children and parents, include multiple components-especially physical activity-and be delivered in accessible settings such as schools or primary care. Yet, the generalizability of findings is limited, as most studies involved children from relatively advantaged backgrounds. Future interventions should integrate SDOH in both design and evaluation to ensure equity and long-term effectiveness in diverse populations.<h4>What is known</h4>• Childhood obesity remains a critical public health issue, heavily influenced by obesogenic environments and social determinants of health (SDOH). • Non-pharmacological interventions, particularly those incorporating physical activity and nutritional guidance, have been commonly used to address childhood obesity, though with varying degrees of success.<h4>What is new</h4>• This review highlights that interventions delivered in healthcare or school settings by multidisciplinary teams, and involving both physical activity and parental engagement, show higher effectiveness in reducing childhood obesity. • The study identifies a significant gap in the integration of social determinants of health in both the design and evaluation of interventions, limiting their long-term impact and equity across diverse populations.",2025,[],[]
Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of VSMC Phenotypic Switching in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are a major cell type in the arterial wall responsible for regulating vascular homeostasis. Under physiological conditions, VSMCs reside in the medial layer of the arteries, express elevated levels of contractile proteins, regulate vascular tone, and provide mechanical strength and elasticity to the blood vessel. In response to obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, critical pathogenic hallmarks of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), VSMCs undergo a phenotypic transformation, adopting new phenotypes with increased proliferative (synthetic), inflammatory (macrophage-like), or bone-like (osteogenic) properties. While crucial for normal repair and vascular adaptation, VSMC phenotypic plasticity is a key driver for the development and progression of macrovascular complications associated with T2D. Despite advances in lineage tracing and multi-omics profiling that have uncovered key molecular regulators of VSMC phenotypic switching in vasculopathy, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying VSMC transformation into diseased phenotypes in T2D remains incomplete. This review will provide a holistic summary of research from the past 15 years, with a focus on the signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators that govern VSMC phenotypic transition in response to obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. We examine the integrated molecular mechanisms that orchestrate VSMC fate reprogramming in T2D and highlight the dynamic interplay among diverse signaling and transcriptional networks. Emphasis is placed on how these interconnected pathways collectively influence VSMC behavior and contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D-associated atherosclerosis.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Central Obesity-related Brain Alterations Predict Cognitive Impairments in First Episode of Psychosis.,"<h4>Background and hypothesis</h4>Cognitive impairment is a key contributor to disability and poor outcomes in schizophrenia, yet it is not adequately addressed by currently available treatments. Thus, it is important to search for preventable or treatable risk factors for cognitive impairment. Here, we hypothesized that obesity-related neurostructural alterations will be associated with worse cognitive outcomes in people with first episode of psychosis (FEP).<h4>Study design</h4>This observational study presents cross-sectional data from the Early-Stage Schizophrenia Outcome project. We acquired T1-weighted 3D MRI scans in 440 participants with FEP at the time of the first hospitalization and in 257 controls. Metabolic assessments included body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), serum concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and hs-CRP. We chose machine learning-derived brain age gap estimate (BrainAGE) as our measure of neurostructural changes and assessed attention, working memory and verbal learning using Digit Span and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test.<h4>Study results</h4>Among obesity/metabolic markers, only WHR significantly predicted both, higher BrainAGE (t(281)=2.53, p=0.012) and worse verbal learning (t(290) = -2.51, P = .026). The association between FEP and verbal learning was partially mediated by BrainAGE (average causal mediated effects, ACME = -0.04 [-0.10, -0.01], P = .022) and the higher BrainAGE in FEP was partially mediated by higher WHR (ACME = 0.08 [0.02, 0.15], P = .006).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Central obesity-related brain alterations were linked with worse cognitive performance already early in the course of psychosis. These structure-function links suggest that preventing or treating central obesity could target brain and cognitive impairments in FEP.",2025,"['insulin', 'hs - crp']",['insulin']
"Unraveling the potential of hypothalamic deep brain stimulation for obesity: Impacts on memory, neuroplasticity and brain metabolism in the Zucker rat.","The lateral hypothalamus (LH) plays a key role in regulating energy balance and appetite, making it a potential target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treatment-resistant obesity. In this study, we evaluated the short and long-term in vivo effects of continuous LH-DBS over 15 days in a genetic model of obesity: the Zucker rat. We examined changes in body weight, brain glucose metabolism (via positron emission tomography, PET), and memory performance, along with ex vivo neuroplasticity in different hippocampal layers one month post-treatment. Contrary to expectations, continuous LH-DBS did not reduce the weight gain or food intake. While stimulated rats exhibited hippocampal hypermetabolism and enhanced synaptogenesis, these changes did not translate into cognitive improvements. Interestingly, long-term memory benefits were observed in all animals that underwent surgery, regardless of whether they received stimulation. In conclusion, our results do not support continuous LH-DBS as an effective treatment to reduce body weight in cases of obesity with genetic leptin resistance. However, the hippocampal modulation induced by continuous LH-DBS shows potential for addressing cognitive impairments associated with leptin resistance. These findings suggest that alternative DBS protocols may help restore hippocampal function, warranting further investigation.",2025,"['l', 'l', 'l', 'leptin', 'leptin']",['leptin']
Microenvironmental determinants of cancer progression during obesity: emerging evidence and novel perspectives.,"Obesity is a global pandemic representing a significant public health threat, with a rising number of affected individuals and numerous associated co-morbidities, including cancer. In obese cancer patients, higher mortality rates are usually observed compared to normal weight/lean individuals. The imbalanced metabolic asset of obese patients fosters tumor growth and its progression by impacting not only on cancer cells, but also affecting their cross-talk with the tumor microenvironment, which represents a relevant and multifaceted player in disease progression. Herein, we deliver a detailed overview of certain peculiar players implicated in the reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment during obesity toward disease evolution. We highlight the key metabolic, molecular and cellular players that co-opt cancer cells and their microenvironment to foster disease progression. We emphasize the role of certain hormones and growth factors-dependent pathways (Insulin/IGF signaling system and VEGF/VEGFR axis) together with inflammatory pathways (RAGE signaling system) in triggering microenvironmental-dependent evolution of neoplastic disease during obesity. Finally, we underline current pitfalls and envisage innovative tools and future directions for better investigating tumor progression in obesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'igf', 'vegf', 'vegfr']","['insulin', 'igf', 'vegf', 'vegfr']"

Ivan Penchev,"" Sofia. Clinical data, including comorbidities, HbA1c, weight, and BMI, were collected from medical records at baseline and after one year of treatment. Patients were administered subcutaneous semaglutide beginning at 0.25 mg weekly, titrated to 0.5 mg after four weeks, and to 1 mg thereafter, maintained over a one-year period.<h4>Results</h4>At baseline, 92.3% of patients had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²), with 53.6% categorized as Obesity Class 1. After one year of GLP - 1RA therapy, significant improvements in metabolic parameters were observed. Median weight reduced from 100.0 kg to 91.5 kg (p<0.001), and median BMI decreased from 33.6 to 30.9 kg/m² (p<0.001). HbA1c levels declined from 7.80% to 6.90% (p<0.001). Transitions to lower obesity classes occurred in 81 patients, while 15 remained in Class 3 obesity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Semaglutide significantly improves glycemic control and promotes weight and BMI reduction in T2DM patients in routine clinical practice. These findings suggest that structured follow-up under endocrinologist supervision, as required by national protocols, may enhance therapeutic response. Further prospective studies with extended follow-up are warranted to evaluate the long-term sustainability of these effects and to identify predictors of optimal patient response.",2025,"['hba1', 'hba1c', 'glp - 1ra', 'hba1c']","['hba1', 'hba1c']"
Loss of histone methyltransferase Smyd3 triggers WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis via enhancing PPARγ expression in a H4K20me3-dependent manner.,"Adaptive thermogenesis driven by brown/beige adipose tissue has gained attention as a promising strategy for combating obesity. Histone methyltransferase SET and MYND Domain Containing 3 (Smyd3) is strongly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, however, its role in adaptive thermogenesis has not been well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Smyd3 is abundant and closely involved in adipocyte thermogenic programming. However, genetic ablation of Smyd3 or pharmacological inhibition with the specific inhibitor EPZ031686 robustly enhanced adaptive thermogenesis in mice. Conversely, Smyd3 overexpression attenuated white adipose tissue (WAT) browning both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that loss of Smyd3 (pharmacological inhibition by EPZ031686, knockdown by Smyd3 siRNA and genetic ablation by Smyd3-KO mice) decreased the trimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) within the promoter region of the transcription factor Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg) gene and released the transcription suppression, thereby upregulating PPARγ expression, which initiates the transcription of thermogenic genes such as Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), ultimately promoting the protein expression of UCP1 in the cytoplasm and triggering the adaptive thermogenesis program. Collectively, our findings identify Smyd3 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating adaptive thermogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of Smyd3 with EPZ031686 represents a promising strategy to promote WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for combating obesity.",2025,"['histone methyltransferase set', 'mynd domain containing 3', 'smyd3', 'smyd3', 'smyd3', 'ep', 'smyd3', 'smyd3', 'smyd3 sirna', 'smyd3', 'histone h4 lysine 20', 'h4k20', 'transcription', 'peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma', 'pparg', 'pparγ', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'ucp1', 'smyd3', 'smyd3', 'e', '##pz']","['smyd3', 'transcription', 'peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma', 'pparg', 'pparγ', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
The Lipid Hydrolase ABHD6 is a Therapeutic Target in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Primary liver cancer accounts for approximately 700,000 deaths worldwide annually ranking third in cancer-related mortality, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) comprising the majority of these tumors. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is currently a leading cause of HCC in the United States. We previously identified the lipid hydrolase alpha/beta hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) as a key mediator of the development of metabolic syndrome and intimately involved in cell signaling, making it a prime target for investigation in MASLD-related HCC. ABHD6 displays higher expression within HCC tumor cores when compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissue in human subjects. Using an in vivo antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-driven knockdown approach, we have shown the inhibition of ABHD6 prevents the development and progression of HCC in an obesity/MASLD-driven mouse model. Additionally, a xenograft model using the human Huh7 cell line displayed reduced tumor engraftment and growth with ABHD6 genetic deletion and small molecule inhibition. ABHD6 knockout cells demonstrated increased levels of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphates (BMPs), lipids relevant to high fat diet-induced lysosomal dysfunction, and knockout cells also demonstrated altered autophagy and lysosomal activity using in vitro model of saturated fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity. These studies reveal novel lipid signaling mechanisms by which MASLD progresses towards HCC and provide support for ABHD6 as a therapeutic target in HCC. <h4>Significance</h4>  We have identified that alpha/beta hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) plays a role in lysosomal membrane lipid remodeling pathways that are relevant in obesity/MASLD-driven HCC. Inhibitors targeting ABHD6 reorganize lysosomal lipid homeostasis to improve outcomes in HCC.",2025,"['lipid hydrolase alpha / beta hydrolase domain 6', 'abhd6', '##sld', 'abhd6', 'abhd6', 'masld', 'abhd6', 'a', '##bhd6', 'masld', 'abhd6', 'alpha / beta hydrolase domain 6', 'abhd6', 'masld', 'abhd6']","['abhd6', 'masld']"
Type 2 Diabetes in a 4-Year-Old With Obesity: Considerations for Use of Semaglutide and Bariatric Surgery in Children.,"The rising prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) in children necessitates early intervention with tight glycemic control, obesity medications, and metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Insulin and metformin are standard treatments, but additional therapies for obesity in youth are needed. A 4-year-old Hispanic female with early-onset obesity and newly diagnosed T2D presented with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 8.0% (reference: < 5.7%), a fasting glucose of 147 mg/dL (SI units: 8.17 mmol/L) (reference: 70-115 mg/dL [3.33-6.39 mmol/L]), and a body mass index (BMI) of 41 kg/m². She had rapid weight gain and hyperphagia. Initially, insulin therapy was started, and her HbA1c decreased to 6.7% over 6 months. Insulin was discontinued and metformin 1000 mg twice daily was started. Topiramate 75 mg nightly was prescribed for obesity with minimal effect and so semaglutide was started and titrated to 2 mg weekly. By 27 months, her HbA1c improved to 5.1%, and overall, she had a 12% reduction in her percent above the 95th percentile (%BMI<sub>p95</sub>; BMI 41 kg/m²→35 kg/m²; %BMI<sub>p95</sub> = 205%→190%). This case underscores the importance of a multi-modal approach to managing pediatric T2D and obesity and highlights the effectiveness of semaglutide in improving both obesity and glycemic control.",2025,"['insulin', 'hemoglobin a1c', 'hba1c', 'insulin', 'hba1c', 'insulin', 'hba1c']","['insulin', 'hemoglobin a1c', 'hba1c']"
Delivery of thermogenic genes to metabolic tissues: Effects on body weight and glucose tolerance.,"Adaptive thermogenesis, particularly via the β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3)-protein kinase A catalytic subunit α (PKA Cα)-uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) pathway, promotes energy expenditure and contributes to metabolic homeostasis, thereby establishing this pathway as a promising therapeutic target for metabolic disorders associated with excessive energy intake. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy targeting thermogenic pathways in metabolic tissues for the treatment of obesity-related dysfunctions. We demonstrated that adipocyte-specific overexpression of UCP1 improved glucose tolerance. Similarly, ADRB3 overexpression significantly enhanced glucose tolerance. Furthermore, ectopic expression of UCP1 in hepatocytes and myofibers also led to improved glucose tolerance. These findings highlight the potential of AAV-mediated gene therapy targeting the ADRB3-PKA Cα-UCP1 axis as a promising strategy for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic disorders.",2025,"['β3 - adrenergic receptor', 'adrb3', 'protein kinase a catalytic subunit α', 'pka cα', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'ucp1', 'adrb3', 'ucp1', 'adrb3', 'pka cα', 'ucp1']","['adrb3', 'pka calpha', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
A digital app-supported general practitioner-led weight loss program improves food literacy and intake in adults in rural Germany: Secondary outcomes of the HAPpEN pragmatic trial,"Obesity prevalence is rising globally and especially in rural areas. Interventions promoting dietary behavior change specifically in rural populations are urgently needed to address this issue. This analysis used data from HAPpEN, a multicomponent, general practitioner (GP)-led and digitally supported obesity management intervention specifically developed to support weight loss in rural adults. It tested whether (1) the intervention induced changes in food literacy and intake and their relationships to changes in body weight, (2) these effects were modulated by the preferred decision-making style, and (3) the intervention induced eating disorder symptoms. Only intervention completers ( N = 61) were included in the analysis. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, six months into the program, and immediately after completing the one-year program. Several aspects of food literacy including daily food planning improved significantly after six months, although the total food literacy score only improved significantly after one year. Food intake improved significantly after six months and stayed stable thereafter. At six months, changes in food intake were also related to changes in body weight. Intervention effectiveness may have dependent on the preferred decision-making style. Eating disorder symptomatology was not worsened through the program. Successful weight loss induced by HAPpEN is likely driven by changes in food literacy and intake. Offering a range of target foods, graded tasks and several complementary intervention components allows for tailoring to varying patient needs, levels of knowledge and behavior, and therefore increases the likelihood for intervention success. This trial was registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00033916).",2025,[],[]
Polycystic ovary syndrome and organochlorine pesticides: exploring potential links and mechanisms.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder among women, characterized by metabolic abnormalities and infertility. Despite its high prevalence, the etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that persistent organic pollutants (POPs), known for their detrimental effects on the endocrine and reproductive systems, may play a role in the development and progression of PCOS. Among POPs, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are particularly widespread and pose significant health risks. This review examines the potential of OCPs as an environmental factor in the development and progression of PCOS. It highlights the mechanisms through which OCPs may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis and impair hormonal regulation, contributing to the onset and exacerbation of PCOS. Evidence links OCPs to insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These disruptions may occur via pathways involving hypothyroidism or altered adrenal androgen secretion. While current evidence supports a plausible connection between OCP exposure and PCOS, significant gaps and inconsistencies in the data warrant further investigation. Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying these associations is crucial for developing targeted prevention and intervention strategies.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Physiological Functions and Pathological Roles of PXR.,"The pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, mainly acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor. PXR is predominantly expressed in the liver and intestines, though it is also present at lower levels in various other tissues. PXR is known for its critical role in regulating the metabolism of various chemical substances, including dietary, xenobiotic, and endogenous compounds. As a master regulator of detoxification pathways, PXR modulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, contributing to the clearance of potentially harmful compounds. Beyond this classic role, emerging evidence highlights a broader role for PXR on metabolic homeostasis and its involvement in several physiological processes and diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PXR functions across several key metabolic pathways. PXR influences glucose homeostasis by modulating the expression of genes involved in glucose production and insulin sensitivity, highlighting its important role in glucose regulation. PXR regulates the synthesis, breakdown, and transport of lipids, and regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol homeostasis. PXR is involved in inflammatory diseases by modulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and immune responses, indicating that PXR is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory disorders. Furthermore, we discuss PXR function on the regulation of vitamin, bone, and bile acid metabolism.",2025,"['pregnane x receptor', 'pxr', 'nr1i2', 'nuclear receptor superfamily', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'insulin', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'pxr', 'pxr']","['pregnane x receptor', 'pxr', 'nr1i2', 'insulin']"

"Use of Semaglutide for Successful Weight Loss and Maintenance in a Non-Obese Population: An Observational, Retrospective Chart Review","<h4>Objectives: </h4> This retrospective chart review aimed to assess the efficacy of compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient of an FDA-approved weight loss drug for patients with obesity, for weight loss in otherwise healthy, regular, and overweight people. Additionally, a novel method to declare the ideal or target weight, which bridges the difference in body composition, bone structure and sex is proposed. Achieving a target weight is also proposed to measure the success of the elective weight loss (EWL™) program. <h4>Methods:</h4> An internal, retrospective chart review was conducted to assess the efficacy and success of an Elective Weight Loss (EWL™) program. Weight was collected on 326 patients (male n=23, female n=303), with a mean age of 42.2 years, for 12 to 120 weeks. Weekly doses, dose adjustments, when semaglutide was stopped, when the target weight was attained, and weight maintenance were collected. No diet was prescribed. <h4>Results:</h4> The results showed that 96% of the patients lost weight. Five patients gained weight, and seven lost no weight. In non-obese patients (n = 233), the mean start BMI was 25.44 ± 2.6 (20-28), and the end mean BMI was 22.99 ± 2.55, p-value &amp;lt;0.001. Obese patients (n = 93) mean BMI was 34.98 ± 4.6, a mean end BMI of 30.72 ± 4.98, p-value &amp;lt;0.001. <h4>Conclusions:</h4> It was concluded that compounded semaglutide was found to be a safe and highly effective off-label option for elective weight loss in normal and overweight individuals. It promotes weight loss at lower doses and shows potential benefits comparable to moderate calorie restriction in improving cardiometabolic health and supporting anti-aging in non-obese people.",2025,[],[]
Association of obesity and adrenal androgen levels with bone age progression in boys with premature adrenarche.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Both premature adrenarche (PA) and obesity are closely linked to increases in bone age (BA). However, the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear as research data, particularly in boys, are lacking. Therefore, our aim in this study was to test for an association between obesity and BA progression in boys with PA and to assess the role of adrenal androgen in the mediation of any identified association.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed data from medical records of prepubertal boys with PA. Participants were categorized into 2 groups based on the difference between their BA and chronological age (CA), BA-CA≥1 and BA-CA&lt;1.<h4>Results</h4>Among 67 boys having a mean age of 8.3±0.7 years, the 27 boys in the BA-CA≥1 group had significantly higher body mass index (BMI) z-scores (1.7±0.9 vs. 1.0±1.3, P=0.022) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) z-scores (1.7±1.3 μg/dL vs. 1.1±0.7 μg/dL, P=0.020), than the 40 boys in the BA-CA&lt;1 group. Multivariate regression analyses revealed a significant association between BMI z-score and BA progression for the BA-CA≥1 group, even after adjusting for DHEA-S z-score, odds ratio=1.605 with P=0.048. Mediation analyses indicated that the direct effect of BMI z-score on BA-CA was statistically significant, β=0.2190 with P=0.039; however, the indirect effect of BMI z-score on BA-CA through DHEA-S z-score was not significant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In boys with PA, higher DHEA-S z-scores and BMI z-scores were associated with BA-CA. However, DHEA-S did not mediate the relationship between obesity and BA progression. Our data suggested that in boys with obesity and PA, the rapid progression of skeletal maturation is primarily the result of a direct impact of obesity on BA and not due to an increase in adrenal androgen levels.",2025,[],[]
"Metabolic syndrome: epidemiology, mechanisms, and current therapeutic approaches.","Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex condition marked by central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. These risk factors significantly raise the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through various mechanisms, leading to a public health challenge. MetS contributes to CVD through cardiometabolic derangements such as endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Dyslipidemia, especially elevated triglycerides and reduced high-density lipo-protein (HDL) cholesterol is central to atherosclerosis. Additionally, hypertension and insulin resistance damage blood vessels, a process exacerbated by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, managing MetS and its components through lifestyle changes like weight control, dietary improvements, exercise, and smoking cessation is essential for reducing CVD risk. Medications targeting specific risk factors, such as blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure, may also be required. Raising awareness and early screening are crucial to countering MetS's impact on public health. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms by which MetS contributes to CVD and the intricate interplay of factors and molecular pathways linking MetS to CVD.",2025,"['insulin', 'high - density lipo - protein', 'hdl ) ch', 'insulin']",['insulin']
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obesity: Overlapping Neuroendocrine, Metabolic, and Behavioral Pathways.","<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed anxiety disorders in primary care. The global lifetime prevalence of GAD is estimated at 3.7%, ranging from 1.6% in low-income countries to 5.0% in high-income countries, underscoring its widespread impact. Given the frequent co-occurrence of GAD with obesity, this association has important clinical implications, particularly for screening, prevention, and treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to identify potential biological mechanisms linking obesity and GAD, summarize the current state of knowledge in this area, and highlight existing research gaps, as well as directions for future research. <b>Methods</b>: This narrative review is based on the literature published between 2015 and 2025 concerning the co-occurrence of GAD and obesity, with a focus on potential shared mechanisms including HPA axis dysregulation, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, gut-brain axis and microbiota dysbiosis, sleep disturbance, and maladaptive eating behaviors. <b>Results/Conclusions</b>: A growing body of evidence suggests an important, albeit still ambiguously defined, relationship between obesity and GAD. GAD and obesity may reinforce each other, leading to a mutually reinforcing relationship. Despite growing interest, high-quality prospective and interventional studies focusing specifically on GAD are lacking. A potentially effective therapeutic approach should be integrated and multidisciplinary, combining psychological, pharmacological, and lifestyle interventions. It may also be beneficial for clinicians to consider routine assessment of anxiety in patients with obesity and, conversely, to monitor metabolic risk in individuals with GAD. Such an approach, targeting both mental and metabolic domains, holds promise for improving outcomes.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Integrative proteomic analysis provides novel therapeutic insights for etiological subtypes of diabetes.,"<h4>Aims</h4>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a highly heterogeneous disease characterised by subtypes with variations in aetiology, disease progression, and risk of complications. However, potential drug targets for these subtypes have not been explored. This study aims to investigate potential drug targets by integrating proteomics.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Summary-level data of circulating proteins were extracted from the UK Biobank and the deCODE Health Study. Genetic associations with five diabetes subtypes were obtained from Swedish All New Diabetics in Scania and Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort, including severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID), severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), and mild age-related diabetes (MARD). The associations between circulating proteins and diabetes subtypes were assessed through Mendelian randomisation, followed by multiple sensitivity and colocalization analyses. Additionally, tissue-specific, pathway and functional enrichment analysis, assessment of protein druggability, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to further explore biological mechanisms and therapeutic potential.<h4>Results</h4>Genetically predicted levels of 2, 2, 9, 3, and 5 circulating proteins were associated with SIRD, SIDD, MARD, MOD, and SAID, respectively. Colocalization analyses further revealed links between GRN with MARD/SIRD, LILRB5 with SIDD/MARD, CR1 with MARD, TNFSF12 with MOD, and DAPK2 with SAID. Enrichment analysis suggested that these proteins were mainly enriched in blood and adipose tissues and involved in immune and inflammatory related pathways. PPI analysis revealed GRN, TNFSF12, and DAPK2 are associated with known T2D targets.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study identified several potential drug targets for different subtypes of diabetes using an integrated genetic approach, yielding new insights for precision medicine of diabetes.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'grn', 'mard', 'sird', 'lilrb5', 'mard', 'cr1', 'mard', 'tnfsf12', 'm', 'dapk2', 'grn', 'tnfsf12', 'dapk2']","['insulin', 'grn', 'lilrb5', 'cr1', 'tnfsf12', 'dapk2']"
Network Pharmacological Analysis of TCM Formulae Based on the Syndrome Ontology and Multidimensional Quantitative Association Computing Platform.,"Current network pharmacology methods for TCM formulae predict potential active ingredients and mechanisms of action for specific diseases by constructing a formula-ingredient-target-pathway-disease network.

By integrating syndrome characteristics into this network, researchers can develop multi-target drugs tailored to each disease stage, enabling precise and personalized treatment. The TCM Syndrome Ontology and Multidimensional Quantitative Association Computing Platform (SoFDA) allow the incorporation of TCM syndromes into network pharmacology analysis. In this study, we used Lingguizhugan Decoction (formula) as an example to demonstrate its application in treating obesity with Yang Deficiency Syndrome and Dampness-Phlegm Syndrome (syndromes).

Epigenetic regulation of miR-211 in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus of female rats during diet-induced obesity and caloric restriction.,"Epigenetic modifications dynamically regulate gene expression in response to environmental factors. miR-211 has been implicated in hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. This study investigates the epigenetic regulation of miR-211 in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of female Wistar rats during diet-induced obesity (DIO) and caloric restriction (CR). Female Wistar rats were subjected to a DIO protocol followed by CR. miR-211 expression was measured in the ARC, and two epigenetic layers-histone methylation (H3K9me2 enrichment) and CpG DNA methylation-were analyzed at the miR-211 promoter. Aml1/Runx1 binding was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation. DIO upregulated miR-211 expression in the ARC, while CR restored it to baseline levels. Increased H3K9me2 enrichment at the miR-211 promoter during DIO was reversed by CR. CpG methylation analysis revealed hypermethylation at the miR-211 promoter, particularly at -78 CpG, during DIO, which partially reverted after CR. Hyper-methylation in DIO was associated with reduced Aml1/Runx1 binding, suggesting a loss of transcriptional repression. Blood samples showed a similar CpG methylation pattern, indicating potential biomarker applications. In conclusion, miR-211 expression in the ARC is regulated by histone and DNA methylation in response to metabolic status. The reversal of these epigenetic changes by CR highlights the potential of lifestyle interventions to mitigate obesity-induced molecular alterations. These findings provide insights into miR-211's role in hypothalamic dysregulation and its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity management.",2025,"['mir - 211', 'mir - 211', 'mir - 211', 'histone', 'h', 'cpg', 'mir - 211 promoter', 'aml1', 'runx1', 'mir - 211', 'h', 'mir - 211 promoter', 'cpg', 'mir - 211 promoter', 'aml1', 'runx1', 'c', '##g', 'mir - 211', 'histone', 'mir - 211']","['histone', 'cpg', 'aml1', 'runx1']"
Improving cardiovascular risk stratification: the role of abdominal obesity in predicting MACEs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate cardiovascular risk (CVR) stratification remains challenging, particularly in identifying individuals with residual risk despite current screening tools. Abdominal obesity reflects visceral adipose tissue, which is metabolically active and strongly linked to pro-inflammatory and atherogenic states. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive utility of baseline cardiometabolic risk factors, with a particular focus on abdominal obesity as quantified by waist circumference (WC), alongside established 10-year CVR scores, for incident Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACEs).<h4>Methods</h4>We prospectively followed 736 outpatients (347 males, 389 females) from an Italian Internal Medicine Unit, initially free of MACEs. Baseline data included anthropometrics, biochemical markers, and calculated Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and SCORE2/SCORE2-OP. Abdominal obesity was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) as a WC ≥ 94 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females. Incident MACEs were recorded during follow-up. Statistical analyses included t-tests, Chi-Square, ANOVA, and logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>Over a median follow-up of 84.9 months, 132 participants (17.9%) developed MACEs. Baseline abdominal obesity, present in 78.1% of the cohort, was significantly associated with incident MACEs (OR = 1.784, 95% CI = 1.04-3.118, p = 0.038), whereas BMI-defined obesity showed no such association (p = 0.394). Low HDL-cholesterol also emerged as a key predictor (OR = 1.672, 95% CI = 1.115-2.482, p = 0.012). In multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for age and other MetS components, abdominal obesity (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.6-4.2, p = 0.001) and low HDL-c (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-3.5, p = 0.001) remained robustly associated with MACEs. Notably, individuals within the SCORE2/SCORE2-OP 'Moderate-Risk' category, despite not being the highest risk overall, exhibited the highest baseline LDL-c levels and accounted for the largest proportion of MACEs (36.4%). Even among participants without baseline abdominal obesity, those who developed MACEs had significantly higher WC (p < 0.0001) and lower HDL-c (p = 0.0078) at baseline.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Abdominal obesity and low HDL-c are potent, independent predictors of cardiovascular events, outperforming traditional markers like BMI. Together with the need of reaching LDL-c serum target levels, these biomarkers are crucial for unmasking the residual risk missed by current stratification models.",2025,"['hdl - cholester', 'hdl - c', 'ldl - c', 'hdl - c', 'h', 'hdl - c', 'ldl - c']",[]
"Deletion of KLHDC3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex substrate receptor, leads to obesity in mice","Protein ubiquitination is a critical post-translational modification that regulates protein stability and cellular homeostasis. KLHDC3 is a substrate recognition receptor within the recently identified C-terminal degron-mediated DesCEND ubiquitination pathway. It has been characterised to selectively bind proteins with C-terminal RxxxG motifs, targeting them for degradation. Unlike the well-characterised N-terminal degron pathway, the physiological roles of C-terminal degrons remain poorly understood. To investigate KLHDC3 function in vivo , we generated Klhdc3-deficient ( Klhdc3 -/- ) mice. These mice exhibited sub-Mendelian birth rates and progressive postnatal lethality, with a median survival of 136 days and maximum survival observed of ∼1 year of age. Early growth retardation was apparent, followed by a normalisation of body mass with age. However, as Klhdc3 -/- mice aged they developed pronounced obesity at the expense of lean mass, with some individuals reaching fat mass exceeding 50% of total body weight. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of Klhdc3 -/- embryonic fibroblasts revealed significant changes in protein expression with minimal impact on transcript levels, consistent with KLHDC3’s role in post-translational regulation. Among the upregulated proteins, HINT1 was identified as a novel KLHDC3 substrate, possessing a C-terminal degron motif. Protein stability assays and immunoblotting confirmed HINT1 as a direct target of KLHDC3. These findings establish a new in vivo physiological role for the DesCEND pathway and highlight KLHDC3 as a key regulator of development, survival, and adiposity in mice.",2025,"['klhdc3', 'klhdc3', 'klhdc3', 'klhdc3', '/ -', 'klhdc3 - /', 'klhdc3', '/', 'klhdc3', 'hint1', 'klhdc3', 'hint1', 'klhdc3', 'klhdc3']","['klhdc3', 'hint1']"

Overexpression of the human heat shock protein B1 alters obesity-related metabolic changes in a sex-dependent manner in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a global health challenge that can lead to various complications, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved chaperones that help maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Their expression is dysregulated in various chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, and they also regulate inflammatory processes. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of a small heat shock protein, HSPB1, on the comorbidities and complications of obesity in a transgenic mouse model.<h4>Methods</h4>Male and female human apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB) transgenic mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) from months 3-10 of age were used as a model of metabolic syndrome (MetS). To study whether HSPB1 influences the development of MetS, APOB animals were crossed with HSPB1-overexpressing mice. Age and sex-matched wild-type and human HSPB1-overexpressing mice were used as controls. Changes in cardiac morphology and function were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography at month 9. At month 10, serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays. Pathological changes in the liver were studied on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Expression levels of genes involved in inflammation and metabolism were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the liver, left ventricle, and visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT).<h4>Results</h4>The body weight and serum LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the APOB animals than in the wild-type mice in both sexes. Notably, HSPB1 overexpression further increased weight gain in female APOB animals. Conversely, in APOB males, HSPB1 overexpression decreased LDL-cholesterol levels without significantly affecting body weight. Furthermore, in APOB females, HSPB1 overexpression elevated Fgf-21 expression in the vWAT, restored Lpl levels, and reduced the expression of several cytokines in the liver. APOB males developed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with diastolic dysfunction. HSPB1 overexpression induced LVH without cardiac dysfunction in the wild-type animals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Both sexes of APOB animals developed MetS. APOB males presented LVH with preserved ejection fraction (EF); however, APOB females showed enlarged left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV). In APOB animals, HSPB1 overexpression exerted a sex-dependent influence on obesity-related alterations, including weight gain, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic and vWAT gene expression.",2025,"['hspb1', 'human apolipoprotein b - 100', 'apob', 'hspb1', 'apob', 'hspb1', 'human hspb1', 'serum', 'ldl - cholesterol', 'apob', 'hspb1', 'apob', 'apob', 'hspb1', 'ldl - cholester', 'apob', 'hspb1', 'fgf - 21', 'lpl', 'apo', 'hspb1', 'a', '##b', 'apob', 'hspb1', 'he', '##tic and', 'vwat gene']","['hspb1', 'apob', 'serum', 'ldl cholesterol', 'lpl', 'apo']"
First Report of a Novel Pathogenic Variant in the RREB1 Gene Associated With Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome.,"Ras-responsive element binding protein 1 (RREB1) is a zinc finger transcription factor that is crucial in regulating cell growth, gene expression, and DNA repair. It functions as both a repressor and an activator, with its activity controlled by the MAPK signaling pathway. RREB1 has been implicated in various conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and cancer, suggesting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target for these diseases. While several cases of 6p terminal deletions in the RREB1 gene and one case of Noonan-like RASopathy due to a loss-of-function variant have been reported, this study presents the first case of a pathogenic loss-of-function variant in RREB1 associated with morbid obesity and metabolic disturbances. Our patient, a 16-year-old male, exhibited morbid obesity, metabolic disorders, moderate intellectual disability, and atypical autism symptoms. He was referred to our clinic by the pediatric endocrinology department for genetic evaluation. Initial genetic testing included karyotype analysis and SNP array testing with 700 000 probes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was then performed on the patient and his family, revealing a de novo novel variant, c.3178_3179del, p.(Glu1060Argfs*37) in the RREB1 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Trends in obesity defined by body mass index among adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a repeated cross-sectional study of the 2009-2023 Canadian Community Heath Surveys.,"<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic affected health behaviours and the social determinants of health. We sought to describe trends in the prevalence in body mass index (BMI) categories before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among adults in Canada.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study of adults in the 2009-2023 Canadian Community Health Surveys. We compared changes after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 to December 2023) to an 11-year prepandemic period (January 2009 to March 2020). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and absolute percentages from, respectively, weighted logistic and linear regression models.<h4>Results</h4>Our unweighted analytic sample included 746 250 adults from the 2009-2023 surveys. The prevalence of BMI-defined obesity increased from 24.95% in 2009 to 32.69% in 2023 (absolute increase 7.74%). The COVID-19 pandemic period was associated with an adjusted annual increase in the relative odds of obesity that was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.04) times greater than the prepandemic period. The absolute rate of increase of BMI-defined obesity nearly doubled during the pandemic, with an annual average excess rate of 0.44 (95% CI 0.14-0.74) percentage points. Class II and III obesity increased at a greater absolute rate than class I, indicating a shift toward more severe obesity. The relative increase in class III obesity was greater among young adults and females.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of BMI-defined obesity, and especially class III obesity, increased at a faster rate than before the pandemic. Some groups that historically had lower levels of obesity were disproportionately affected during the pandemic.",2025,[],[]
"A combined in vitro, in vivo and in silico approach for the discovery of bioactive molecules from Corchorus olitorius L as pancreatic lipase inhibitors, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α.","This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects of bioactive compounds derived from Corchorus olitorius L., using a combined in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approach. The in vitro phase involved polyphenol extraction and antioxidant activity assays. The in vivo phase used a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in Wistar rats divided into four groups: standard diet (STD), high-fat diet (HFD), STD with C. olitorius extract (STD + C. olitorius), and HFD with C. olitorius extract (HFD + C. olitorius). Rats received a daily oral administration of C. olitorius extract (100 mg/kg) throughout a 9-week treatment period. Plasma biochemical parameters and adipose tissue histology were assessed. The in silico phase involved molecular docking of previously identified and synthesized C. olitorius compounds against obesity- and inflammation-related targets (TNF-α, IL-6, PL), followed by ADMET predictions and analog design via bioisosteric replacement. C. olitorius treatment reduced body weight gain, visceral fat accumulation, and lipid parameters in HFD-fed rats. Histological analysis showed decreased fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in adipose tissue, supporting its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Molecular docking revealed that key compounds-particularly L7 (methyl-1,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and L2 (3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid)-demonstrated strong binding affinities to proinflammatory cytokines and pancreatic lipase. Analog compounds designed via bioisosteric modification retained favorable biological activity. ADME analysis indicated that the principal compounds possess favorable oral absorption properties and align with drug-likeness criteria. Compared to orlistat, these natural compounds offer a safer profile with reduced toxicity risks. This study highlights the multi-target therapeutic potential of C. olitorius derived compounds-particularly L7 and its analogs-as promising candidates for natural anti-obesity drug development. To fully establish their therapeutic value, comprehensive preclinical and clinical investigations are necessary to evaluate both efficacy and safety. Nonetheless, the current study is limited by the need for mechanistic validation and long-term toxicity assessments.",2025,"['tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'pl', 'pancreatic lipase']",['pancreatic lipase']
Rhynchophylline Reverses Obesity in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Rats by Regulating the Inflammatory Cascade and Blocking 3‑hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase.,"Obesity is a metabolic disorder that could be the reason for the development of several disorders, and its management is necessary. The investigation evaluated the beneficial effect of rhynchophylline on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Obesity was induced with the HFD for 4 weeks, and rhynchophylline at 50 and 100 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for the next 4 weeks in the respective groups. Blood glucose and lipid profiles were estimated in rhynchophylline-treated HFD-induced obese rats. Levels of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative stress parameters were estimated in the liver tissue and blood of all the groups of rats. The weight of adipose tissue and other organs, such as the liver and pancreas, was measured in the rats. The binding affinity of rhynchophylline with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase, <i>in silico</i>) was estimated through a docking study. Treatment with rhynchophylline ameliorated the altered levels of glucose and lipid profiles in the serum of the obese rats. The weight of adipose tissue isolated from different regions of the body was reduced in the rhynchophylline-treated group compared to that in the obese group. There was a significant reduction of oxidative stress in the rhynchophylline-treated group compared with the obese group of rats. The in silico study showed that rhynchophylline binds with HMG-CoA reductase with a binding energy of -8.37 kcal/mol. In conclusion, data from the report reveal that rhynchophylline reduces obesity by promoting the conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT), as it interacts with HMG-CoA reductase in HFD-induced obese rats.",2025,"['3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase', 'hmg - coa reductase', 'hmg - coa reductase', 'hmg - coa reductase']",['hmg coa reductase']
Involvement of miRNAs in the Cluster of Metabolic Factors of MetS: Nutrition-Genome-MetS Axis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression and play essential roles in physiological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism. They have emerged as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). In recent years, exosome-derived miRNAs, known as ""xeno-miRNAs"", which are derived from food, as well as circulating miRNAs, have emerged as areas of intense research due to their potential effects on metabolic disorders. miRNAs influence fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance through mechanisms such as β-cell differentiation, insulin gene transcription, and PI3K-AKT pathway activation. Additionally, miRNAs play important roles in regulating MetS components, as follows: obesity through adipogenesis and lipogenesis; hypertension through regulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vascular tone; and dyslipidemia by modulating lipid metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests that nutrients such as polyphenols and specific dietary patterns can alter miRNA expression, potentially impacting metabolic health. Understanding the interactions between diet and miRNA regulation offers novel insights into the prevention and treatment of MetS. This review explores the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence MetS components, and highlights the growing potential of nutrient-regulated miRNAs as therapeutic targets within the framework of precision nutrition and personalized metabolic disease management.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin gene', 'p', '##i3k', 'a', '##kt', 'renin', 'angiotensin']","['insulin', 'renin', 'angiotensin']"
Noncommunicable diseases: a silent epidemic in occupied palestine: results from the world health organization STEPS survey 2022.,"<h4>Background</h4>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among Palestinians, accounting for 71.8% of all deaths in 2023. Following the initial STEPS survey conducted in 2010/2011 and in accordance with WHO recommendations, a second STEPS survey was carried out for the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) between August and October 2022.<h4>Methods</h4>The target population for the survey included all Palestinian individuals between 18 and 69 years of age residing in the West Bank and Gaza. A three-stage stratified cluster sampling method was used to randomly select a sample of 5,775 adults from 525 enumeration areas, comprising 3,135 individuals from the West Bank and 2,640 from the Gaza Strip. Of the target sample, 5503 adults participated in the survey.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of smoking, obesity, and insufficient physical activity among Palestinians was notably high, with rates of 33.5%, 31.6%, and 21.1%. The prevalence of smoking among men in the West Bank was alarmingly high and was the highest in the world. In terms of diet, 84.3% of the participants reported an insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables, and 26.5% always or often added salt to their food before eating. Among the Palestinian population aged 18-69 years, 7.6% had raised fasting blood glucose (≥ 126 mg/dl) or were currently on medication for raised blood glucose; and 17.1% of adults between the ages of 40-69 years had a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) risk ≥ 20% or had existing CVD. More than 55% of men and women aged 45-69 had three or more risk factors for NCDs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of risk factors for NCDs was notably high in oPt. These results underscore the urgent need for interventions to reduce the imminent burden of NCDs within this vulnerable population. The worsening crisis in Gaza demands immediate action. Unified and decisive global efforts are essential to halt the war in Gaza, secure a permanent ceasefire, and ensure access to humanitarian aid. While rebuilding the healthcare system will be a long-term undertaking, empowering local professionals, investing in essential infrastructure, and providing sustained support can offer renewed hope to patients with NCDs.",2025,[],[]
A deep dive into the surgical and pharmacological considerations of obesity in chronic myeloid leukemia: a narrative review.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>The rising prevalence of obesity presents significant challenges in managing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Bariatric surgery alters the bioavailability of oral medications, necessitating tailored treatment strategies for obese CML patients. This review aims to summarize the existing literature regarding CML management in patients with obesity and related surgeries, providing novel recommendations for their medical and surgical management.<h4>Methods</h4>A narrative review was performed, analyzing English-language articles published up to 2024. Key aspects considered included the impact of obesity and surgery on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with weight loss medications, and the role of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The review also examined the implications of obesity on CML patient outcomes and treatment milestones, aiming to establish a pathway for managing these patients.<h4>Results/discussion</h4>Clinical data on CML management in obese patients is limited. Gastric bypass surgery may impair TKI efficacy due to reduced gastric acid secretion, affecting drug absorption. Adjustments like deflating gastric bands may enhance TKI absorption. The concurrent use of proton pump inhibitors can significantly lower the efficacy of certain TKIs, while others can be safely co-administered. Notably, patients with prior bariatric surgery show delayed treatment response milestones and may require TKI dose adjustments based on molecular responses rather than TDM.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patients with CML planning bariatric surgery should receive comprehensive preoperative counseling regarding its effects on TKI therapy. Achieving deep remission pre-surgery is advisable, and delaying procedures when malabsorption is anticipated may enhance treatment outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach is essential in considering weight-loss medications, with further research needed to optimize TKI dosing in this population.",2025,"['tyrosine kinase', 't', 'tki', 'tki', 'tki', 'tki', 'tki']",['tyrosine kinase']
Efficacy and Safety of IDegLira in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Clinical trials indicate that IDegLira is effective in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) comprehensively.<h4>Methods</h4>To identify relevant randomized controlled trials, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Risk Ratios (RR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel approach for dichotomous outcomes. Mean Difference (MD) and 95% CI calculated by the inverse variance approach were applied to continuous outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve randomized controlled trials involving 7628 participants were included in this study. Compared with control groups, IDegLira has a significant hypoglycemic effect in reducing hemoglobin A1c (MD = -0.66; 95% CI [-0.85, -0.47]; p < 0.00001), fasting plasma glucose (MD = -0.90; 95% CI [-1.40, -0.41]; p = 0.0003), self-measured plasma glucose (MD = -0.82; 95% CI [-1.22, -0.42]; p < 0.0001) and achieving the hemoglobin A1c level of < 7.0%(RR = 1.66; 95% CI [1.44, 1.92]; p < 0.00001) or < 6.5% (RR = 2.13; 95% CI [1.76, 2.57]; p < 0.00001). IDegLira outperforms insulin in achieving the target of HbA1c < 7.0 or < 6.5% without hypoglycemia and weight gain. Besides, IDegLira did not increase the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events.<h4>Discussion</h4>In this section, IDegLira's benefits on simultaneously achieving glycemic control, weight loss, and reduced hypoglycemia risk were summarized. The statistical results were carefully interpreted in conjunction with clinical concerns regarding T2DM complications, adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness differences. An expanded discussion was conducted on integrating individualized HbA1c goals as a dual endpoint, without increasing body weight or the risk of hypoglycemia. Finally, the limitations of the present study are indicated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>IDegLira exhibits a favorable glycemic control effect and acceptable adverse effects in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Superior performance in the target glycemic control, particularly suitable for T2DM patients who do not reach the target hemoglobin A1c and have comorbid CVD or obesity.",2025,"['hemoglobin a1c', 'hemoglobin a1c', 'insulin', 'hba1', 'hba1c', 'hemoglobin a1c']","['hemoglobin a1c', 'insulin', 'hba1', 'hba1c']"
Evaluation of miRNA Profile and Its Relationship with Metabolic Disorders in Obese and Pre-Obese Patients.,"Obesity is a growing global public health concern, with its prevalence rapidly increasing in Turkey, leading to severe consequences. Genetic factors, particularly mutations in structural genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in gene expression regulation have been widely investigated in obesity research. This study aimed to explore the role of obesity-associated miRNAs and their potential interaction with vascular response alterations. A total of 60 obese and pre-obese patients and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from the General Surgery Department of Fırat University Medicine School were included. The expression levels of 93 miRNAs were analyzed in 86 samples using the Fluidigm Biomark RT-PCR system, with 5S RNA as the housekeeping gene. Significant differences were observed in weight, BMI, cholesterol, triglyceride levels, and lymphocyte counts between the groups (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Several miRNAs, including hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-503-3p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, and hsa-miR-199a-3p, were significantly downregulated in obese patients. Additionally, gender-specific differences in miRNA expression were identified. These findings indicate that miRNAs play a crucial role in obesity pathophysiology and could serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for obesity treatment.",2025,"['5s rna', 'hsa - mir - 148a - 3p', 'hsa - mir - 503 - 3p', 'hsa - mir - 34a - 5p', 'hsa - mir - 199a - 3p']",[]
Association of body composition trajectories with changes in cognitive performance in the Look AHEAD study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal association of total body fat and appendicular lean mass (ALM), as well as sarcopenia, with cognitive decline after weight loss intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>Among 972 Look AHEAD-MIND participants with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, we investigated the longitudinal association of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body composition trajectories with cognitive change. We identified three latent trajectories each for total body fat and ALM. Mixed linear regression models were adjusted for the following: repeated measures; order of cognitive test; years from randomization; randomization arm; age; sex; race and ethnicity; and education. We also investigated differences in cognitive score by sarcopenia and BMI categories.<h4>Results</h4>A gradual decrease in total body fat and no decrease in ALM were significantly independently associated with higher cognitive scores compared with other trajectories. Differences in cognitive score were large for sarcopenia, but not for obesity. Full adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors substantially attenuated the estimates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Weight loss approaches that preserve ALM and function may lead to reduced cognitive decline compared with weight loss alone. The improved ability to target interventions toward those who are more resilient to aging-related body composition changes may prevent unintended consequences of weight loss.",2025,[],[]
Falcarindiol promotes beige adipocyte-related gene expression and mitochondrial respiration in human preadipocyte-derived adipocytes.,"Falcarindiol, a typical polyacetylene compound found in Apiaceae vegetables, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). However, whether it induces the browning of adipocytes through PPARγ activation is unclear. In this study, we aimed to clarify the effects of falcarindiol on adipocyte browning and mitochondrial respiration in human preadipocyte-derived adipocytes. Human primary cultured cells were differentiated for 8 days in the presence of falcarindiol. The expression of PPARγ target and beige adipocyte-related genes was measured using quantitative real-time PCR, and the accumulation of lipid droplets and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) protein expression were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The oxygen consumption rate was measured using a Seahorse flux analyzer. Falcarindiol increased the expression of PPARγ target genes, including <i>PPARγ</i>, <i>FABP4</i>, <i>SLC2A4</i>, and <i>ADIPOQ</i>. It also increased the expression of beige adipocyte-related genes, such as <i>PPARGC1A</i>, <i>PPARA</i>, <i>CITED1</i>, and <i>TBX1</i>, and increased the expression of UCP1 protein. Falcarindiol also significantly increased basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiration, spare capacity, and proton-leak respiration, and significantly decreased the coupling efficiency in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that falcarindiol promotes a beige adipocyte-like phenotype and oxygen consumption of adipocytes in vitro, suggesting that dietary intake of falcarindiol and falcarindiol-containing Apiaceae vegetables may be effective in obesity prevention.",2025,"['peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ', 'pparγ', 'pparγ', 'pparγ target', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'pparγ target genes', 'pparγ', 'fabp4', 's', '##lc2a4', 'adipoq', 'ppargc1a', 'ppara', 'tbx1', 'ucp1 protein']","['pparγ', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'fabp4', 'adipoq', 'ppargc1a', 'ppara', 'tbx1', 'ucp1 protein']"
"Network pharmacology analysis of ""Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction"" in the treatment of obesity-associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent liver condition closely associated with obesity, affecting nearly one billion adults worldwide. ""Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction,"" a traditional Chinese medicine composed of Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes macrocephala and Licorice, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating obesity-associated NAFLD. The active components and targets of ""Ling Gui Zhu Gan Decoction"" were identified using the TCMSP, PubChem and Swiss Target Prediction databases. Disease targets for NAFLD and obesity were retrieved from GeneCards. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, followed by functional enrichment analyses (GO and KEGG).

Kindergarten-based obesity prevention trial based on self-regulation strategy: study protocol of the Wuhan preschoolers' healthy start project.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity has surged in China, with preschool years being a critical window for intervention. Despite this, evidence-based randomized trials remain scarce, and traditional prevention strategies focusing on knowledge dissemination show limited long-term efficacy. The Wuhan Preschool Healthy Start (WPHS) project addresses this gap through a kindergarten-based trial integrating self-regulation strategies with energy balance-related behavior (EBRB) interventions.<h4>Methods</h4>This stratified randomized controlled trial enrolls children from 26 Wuhan kindergartens (13 intervention, 13 control) over 18 months. The multicomponent intervention targets diet, physical activity, sleep, sedentary behavior, and self-regulation, engaging children, families, and kindergarten environments. Control groups follow standard curricula. Primary outcome is the change in BMI z-score. Secondary outcomes assess behavioral factors (diet, sleep, activity), self-regulation skills, and other anthropometric indicators. Analyses adhere to intention-to-treat principles, using linear mixed models to evaluate intervention effects across strata while exploring potential effect modifiers including kindergarten level, child gender, and age.<h4>Discussion</h4>This intervention hypothesizes that the integrated components of health knowledge, behavior, and self-regulation will not only support the adoption of targeted health behaviors but also ensure their long-term maintenance. This unique approach makes the WPHS project an innovative and holistic initiative to prevent childhood obesity, providing valuable insights into public health strategies for this critical population. We anticipate that incorporating self-regulation training will improve the sustainability of behavior changes, addressing a key gaps in current preschool obesity interventions.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2200058452.",2025,[],[]
"Leptin and leptin resistance in obesity: current evidence, mechanisms and future directions.","Leptin, a key adipokine regulating energy homeostasis, has been extensively studied for its potential in the management of obesity. However, its therapeutic efficacy is often limited due to leptin resistance. This review synthesizes animal and clinical evidence on leptin's role in obesity, focusing on models such as genetically deficient mice (e.g., ob/ob, db/db), diet-induced obesity mice, and clinical conditions such as congenital leptin deficiency (CLD), leptin receptor deficiency (LRD), lipodystrophy, and common obesity. The mechanisms underlying leptin resistance are summarized, including hyperleptinemia, impaired JAK2-STAT3 signaling, reduced blood-brain barrier permeability, defective autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, decreased leptin receptor expression, leptin signaling pathway dysfunction, increased mTOR activity, and peripheral leptin resistance. Due to these leptin receptor and/or post-receptor signaling pathway defects, leptin or its analogs usually fail to produce the expected weight-loss effect in individuals with overweight or obesity, although they remain highly effective in individuals with CLD and lipodystrophy, as well as in ob/ob mice. Alternative strategies, such as melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists (e.g., setmelanotide) for LRD treatment, are very promising. Future directions include enhancing leptin sensitization, combining leptin with other drugs, and exploring partial leptin reduction to mitigate compensatory responses during weight loss.

"TRIM59 deficiency aggravates HFD-induced obesity in mice associated with increased adipose tissue inflammation, lipid accumulation, and apoptosis.","TRIM59 (tripartite motif-containing 59) is involved in many pathological processes including inflammation and tumorigenesis. However, the effect of TRIM59 on obesity remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of TRIM59 in obesity and clarify the involved mechanisms. Our results showed that TRIM59 expression was significantly decreased in fat from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. The TRIM59<sup>+/-</sup> mice with HFD showed increased body weight and white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, larger adipocyte sizes, and increased adipose tissue inflammation with the elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 accompanied by an increased macrophage infiltration. Moreover, TRIM59 knockdown increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Mechanistically, TRIM59 knockdown is associated with heightened activation of TLR4/JNK-p38/NF-κB signaling pathways to promote inflammation, increase adipogenesis and lipogenesis related genes while decreased lipolysis and β-oxidation related genes expression to increase lipid accumulation, simultaneously increased Bax and caspase 3 while decreased Bcl-2 expression to induce apoptosis, thereby leading to obesity. Taken together, our findings define a new critical biological role of TRIM59 in the regulation of diet-induced obesity through attenuating inflammation, improving lipid metabolism and apoptosis, and we conclude that TRIM59 may provide a novel insight in therapeutic target research for treatment of obesity-associated metabolic diseases.",2025,"['trim59', '##artite motif - containing 59', 'trim59', 'trim59', 'trim59', 'trim59', 'tnf - α', 'il - 1β', 'il - 6', 'trim59', 'low - density lipoprotein cholester', 'ldl - c', 'trim59', 't', '##lr4', 'jnk', 'p38', 'nf - κb', 'bax', 'caspase 3', 'b', '##cl - 2', 'trim59', 'trim59']","['trim59', 'jnk', 'p38', 'bax', 'caspase 3']"

The miRNomics of antiretroviral therapy-induced obesity.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that incorporates its genetic material into the host's chromosome. The resulting diseases and related conditions constitute a global health problem as there are no treatments to eliminate HIV from an infected individual. However, the potent, complex, and active antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategies have been able to successfully inhibit HIV replication in patients. Unfortunately, obesity following ART is frequent among HIV-infected patients. The mechanism underlying ART-induced obesity is characterized based on expression of traditional markers such as genes and proteins. However, little is known about, yet another key component of molecular biology known as microRNAs (miRNAs). Micro-RNAs are ~ 22 base-long non-coding nucleotides capable of regulating more than 60% of all human protein-coding genes. The interest in miRNA molecules is increasing and their roles in HIV and obesity are beginning to be apparent. In this review, we provide an overview of HIV and its associated diseases, ART-induced obesity, and discuss the roles and plausible benefits of miRNAs in regulating obesity genes in HIV-infected patients. Understanding the roles of miRNAs in ART-induced obesity will aid in tracking the disease progression and designing beneficial therapeutic approaches.",2025,[],[]

Publication bias was evaluated using a contour-enhanced funnel plot and Egger's test.<h4>Results</h4>Fifteen studies (n = 929) were included. IF significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (MD = -4.43 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.83 to -3.03, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (MD = -2.00 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.23 to -0.78, p < 0.001) compared to control. IF also improved anthropometric measures, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and Triglycerides (TG). Seven studies reported minor adverse effects. Although the IF group showed a higher risk of vomiting (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19, p = 0.01) and irritability (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.13-1.31, p < 0.001) compared to the control group, these reactions were predominantly observed during the initial phase of the intervention and were self-resolving.<h4>Conclusions</h4>IF significantly lowered SBP and DBP in individuals with overweight or obesity, particularly in high-risk subgroups (obesity, age ≥45 years, and prehypertension/hypertension), with a favorable safety profile. Due to heterogeneity, future trials should standardize IF regimens and target these subgroups to confirm generalizability.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>The review protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024540777).",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Role of glycoproteins in hepatic lipid metabolism: emerging diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.,"The liver is an important metabolic organ in the human body, and abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism may lead to a variety of diseases such as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. These diseases are often closely associated with chronic diseases, including obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes, and have become major factors increasing the global disease burden. Currently, the diagnosis of diseases related to hepatic lipid metabolism relies mainly on imaging findings and serologic markers. In terms of treatment, lifestyle interventions such as dietary changes and increased exercise remain the mainstay of the fight against the diseases. However, effective therapies to control the progression of these diseases are still lacking. Glycoproteins are complex biomolecules consisting of sugar chains and proteins bound covalently, which are widely found in cell membranes and secretory fluids. In recent years, researchers have found that glycoproteins have potential application value in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to hepatic lipid metabolism. But there are currently no articles summarizing and analyzing the pathways and mechanisms involved. This review provides an overview of the progress of research on glycoproteins involved in diseases related to hepatic lipid metabolism as well as new insights into glycoproteins as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for lipid metabolism diseases.",2025,[],[]
Shared pathogenic mechanisms linking obesity and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis revealed by bioinformatics and in vivo validation.,"Previous studies have suggested a potential correlation between obesity and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to elucidate pathogenic pathways connecting obesity and IPF and identify diagnostic biomarkers for obesity-related pulmonary fibrosis. Obesity and IPF datasets were obtained through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify shared genes for obesity and IPF. Functional enrichment (GO/KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and machine learning algorithms were applied to screen hub genes, validated by ROC curves. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis underwent histological assessment and qRT-PCR validation. Molecular docking evaluated flavonoid binding to hub genes. We identified 128 shared genes between obesity and IPF, predominantly enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. Machine learning prioritized three hub genes (NLRC4, SPI1, and NCF2), validated by ROC analysis (AUC > 0.7). In animal model, these genes exhibited significant upregulation, correlating with exacerbated fibrosis. Molecular docking highlighted strong binding affinities (-6.3 to -9.6 kcal/mol) between dietary flavonoids and hub targets. Immune-inflammatory dysregulation links obesity and IPF via NLRC4, SPI1, and NCF2. These genes serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with flavonoids showing intervention potential.

Flavonoids in &lt;i&gt;Rosa roxburghii&lt;/i&gt; Tratt Fermentation Broth Ameliorate Obesity via DNMT3a/SIRT1-Mediated Epigenetic Modulation.,"Obesity-related complications are often driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, exacerbated by aberrant DNA methylation. Natural products with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may offer therapeutic potential. This study investigated the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of <i>Rosa roxburghii</i> Tratt fermentation broth (RRTFB) on obesity through targeted methylation, while also examining its primary active components and assessing its potential therapeutic value. Male SD rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity, with RRTFB administered as an intervention. Various methods, including reduced representation bisulfite sequencing analysis (RRBS), molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and other analytical methods were employed for the study. The results showed that, compared to the HFD-fed rats, the RRTFB intervention groups (HFH and HFL) exhibited a significant reduction in MDA, IL-6, TNF-α and DNMT3a levels, along with increased SOD, GSH-pX, and CAT activities in epididymal fat. RRBS revealed a significant number of differential methylation regions (DMRs) in genes related to fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation in HFD-fed rats and HFH. Protein interaction analysis and subsequent validation experiments identified SIRT1 as a key regulator mediating the efficacy of RRTFB: RRTFB reduced SIRT1 promoter methylation and enhanced its expression. In 3T3-L1 cells with Dnmt3a overexpression, SIRT1 levels were significantly reduced. ChIP-qPCR further confirmed an enhanced binding of Dnmt3a to the <i>SIRT1</i> promoter. Molecular docking and SPR confirmed that flavonoids, the active components of RRTFB, could directly bind to DNMT3a and modulate its activity. This study substantiates the potential of RRTFB as a phytochemo therapeutic strategy for combating obesity, highlighting its ability to mitigate obesity through DNMT3a/SIRT1-mediated epigenetic regulation, with flavonoids identified as the primary bioactive components.",2025,"['rrtfb', 'rrtfb', 'mda', 'il - 6', 'tnf - α', 'dnmt3a', 'sod', 'gsh - px', 'cat', 'sirt1', 'rrtfb', 'rrtfb', 'sirt1 promoter', 'dnmt3a', 'sirt1', 'dnmt3a', 'sirt1', 'rrtfb', 'dnmt3a', 'rrtfb', 'dnmt3a', 'sirt1']","['mda', 'dnmt3a', 'sod', 'cat', 'sirt1']"
"Efficacy and safety of danuglipron (PF-06882961) in adults with obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study.","<h4>Aims</h4>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of danuglipron (PF-06882961), an oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, in adults with obesity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Eligible participants (aged 18-75 years; with obesity, without diabetes) were randomized to receive danuglipron or placebo twice daily (BID) for 26 or 32 weeks. Danuglipron was escalated to doses of 40-200 mg BID in 1-, 2-, or 4-week intervals. Assessments included body weight, waist circumference, and safety evaluations.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 628 participants were randomized; of 626 receiving study treatment (placebo, n = 90; danuglipron, n = 536), 39.3% completed treatment. Approximately 38% of participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events (AEs) and 22% discontinued for other reasons. The primary endpoint was the change in weight from baseline to the end of treatment; all danuglipron groups demonstrated statistically significant reductions with least squares mean percentage decreases from baseline ranging from -5.0% (90% confidence interval [CI] -6.8%, -3.2%) to -12.9% (90% CI -16.1%, -9.5%) relative to placebo. Danuglipron was considered safe. Consistent with the mechanism, the most frequently reported events were nausea and vomiting, and increased rates of gastrointestinal AEs were generally observed at higher doses. Most events were reported as mild, and no other dose-related trends were observed in safety endpoints.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In participants with obesity, danuglipron resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in body weight versus placebo over 26 or 32 weeks. The overall safety profile observed in this study was consistent with expectations for the mechanism, although discontinuation rates due to AEs were higher than anticipated across all treatment groups, including placebo.<h4>Clinicaltrials</h4>gov identifier: NCT04707313.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glp - 1 ) receptor']",['glucagon like peptide 1']
Pharmaco-Epigenetics and Epigenetic Drugs in Type 2 Diabetes: Can Epigenetics Predict Drug Efficiency?,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is increasingly affecting individuals across various age groups due to inadequate insulin action and secretion. It has become the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with an estimated 9.3% of the global population currently affected. Recent epigenetic studies have shown that variations such as DNA methylation and histone modifications are implicated in the development of T2DM. However, epigenetically related conditions are known to be reversible, which could potentially pave the way for predicting and treating T2DM. This has led to the development of epigenetic modifier drugs, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi), protein arginine methyltransferase inhibitors (PRMTi), DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), histone demethylating inhibitors (HDMi), and sirtuin-activating compounds (STAC). A major challenge with these epigenetic drugs is that only a few have been approved for treating metabolic diseases due to their potential to negatively impact off-target genes. The low specificity of these drugs can lead to side effects and increased toxicity, contributing to complex diseases such as cancer. Hence, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying metabolic diseases can provide new insights and strategies for preventing, diagnosing, and treating metabolic disorders, such as T2DM. This review summarizes the epigenetic variations in T2DM, pharmaco-epigenetics, and the challenges surrounding epigenetics. This provides basic insight into the discovery of novel drug targets, which can lead to the development of epigenetic therapies for T2DM. Hence, the reversible nature of epigenetic variations retains hope for future novel strategies to combat T2DM.",2025,"['insulin', 'histone', 'histone deacetylase', 'h', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'protein arginine methyltransferase', 'prm', 'dna methyltransferase inhibitor', 'histone demethylating inhibitors', 'hdmi', 'sirtuin - activating compounds', 'stac']","['insulin', 'histone', 'histone deacetylase', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'protein arginine methyltransferase', 'dna methyltransferase inhibitor', 'stac']"

The inhibitor VB-87531 synergizes with tirzepatide and semaglutide for greater weight loss in DIO mice.,"Excessive caloric intake, particularly dietary triglycerides contributes to the development of obesity. Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (hMOGAT2/mMgat2) plays a crucial role in their resynthesis for their transport to the liver. The human MOGAT2 inhibitor BMS-963272 has been demonstrated to induce weight loss in healthy obese individuals, thereby positioning hMOGAT2 as a promising target for weight management interventions. We have identified VB-87531 as a highly potent (IC<sub>50</sub> = 17.4 nM) small molecule inhibitor of hMOGAT2 activity and demonstrate that administration of VB-87531 to obese mice fed a high-fat diet results in weight loss and reduced food intake. VB-87531-treated mice exhibit lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels relative to untreated controls, with no observed liver toxicity. Furthermore, VB-87531 in combination with either the GLP-1/GIP dual receptor agonist, tirzepatide, or the GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, resulted in enhanced weight loss and reduced food intake compared to VB-87531 monotherapy. Combination therapy also significantly lowered insulin and leptin levels while increasing FGF21 and PYY. When combined with tirzepatide, VB-87531 exhibited dose-dependent modulation of weight loss and food intake. These findings indicate that not only does VB-87531 have potential as a standalone therapy, but that it also holds promise in combination with GLP-1 receptor and GLP-1/GIP dual receptor agonists to achieve further weight loss and appetite suppression.",2025,"['monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2', 'hmogat2', 'mmgat2', 'human mogat2', 'hmogat2', 'hmogat2', 'glp - 1', 'gip', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'fgf21', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1', 'gip']","['glp 1', 'gip', 'glp 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'fgf21']"
S100A8/S100A9 impairs energy expenditure and whole body metabolism.,"Thermogenic adipose tissue, specialized in dissipating chemical energy as heat, represents a promising therapeutic target for combating obesity and type 2 diabetes. S100A8/S100A9 is an inflammatory alarmin and biomarker implicated in various diseases, including obesity. Here, we investigated the role of S100A8/S100A9 in thermogenesis and whole-body energy homeostasis. Wild-type (WT) and S100A8/S100A9-deficient (<i>S100a9</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice were subjected to a 14-wk high-fat diet (HFD). Thermogenic responses were assessed through cold exposure and administration of the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,423, with additional experiments involving exogenous S100A8/S100A9 administration in WT mice. Under normal chow, <i>S100a9</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a leaner phenotype compared with WT controls. Following HFD-induced obesity, <i>S100a9</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed reduced weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, increased lipid storage in epididymal adipose tissue, and attenuated hepatic steatosis. Physiological studies using metabolic cages revealed higher oxygen consumption and heat production in lean <i>S100a9</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice following chronic CL-316,423 treatment. In line, <i>S100a9</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited increased beiging in inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT), but not in brown adipose tissue (BAT), under cold exposure as well as acute and chronic CL-316,423. Conversely, exogenous S100A8/S100A9 administration under both cold challenge and chronic CL-316,423 suppressed thermogenic gene expression in ingWAT, with no significant effect in BAT. In vitro, stimulation of immortalized beige adipocytes with S100A9 led to downregulation of beige adipocyte marker genes. Collectively, these findings identify S100A8/S100A9 as a negative regulator of ingWAT beiging and energy expenditure, thereby contributing to impaired metabolic homeostasis and exacerbation of diet-induced obesity.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Obesity is a disorder characterized by disrupted energy homeostasis. During obesity, thermogenic pathways decline, making strategies that enhance energy expenditure a promising avenue for intervention. The alarmin complex S100A8/S100A9 is upregulated in both human and experimental models of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we identify a critical pathogenic role of S100A8/S100A9 in impairing thermogenesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue, reducing energy expenditure, and exacerbating obesity and its related complications.",2025,"['s100a8', 's100a9', 's100a8', 's100a', 's100a8', 's100a9', 's100a9', 'β3 - adrenergic receptor', 's100a8', 's100a9', 's100a9', 's100a9', 'insulin', 's100a9', 's100a9', 's100a8', 's100a9', 's100a9', 's100a8', 's100a9', 'alarmin', 's100a8', 's100a9', 's100a8', 's100a']","['s100a8', 's100a9', 's100a', 'insulin', 'alarmin']"

The Clinical Relevance of FTO as a Demethylase Beyond Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities.,"The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is a key gene that has been linked to obesity and metabolic regulation. FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of various multisystem diseases via epigenetic mechanisms. Although FTO has been extensively reviewed in the context of cancer, a comprehensive evaluation of its role in non-malignant diseases is currently lacking. This review aimed to systematically assess the molecular functions of FTO in the context of diseases other than cancer based on recent insights from the literature. Relevant studies were retrieved by systematically searching the PubMed database to explore the mechanisms through which FTO acts as a mediator of demethylation, its biological activities, and its functional roles in a spectrum of non-oncologic diseases. To explore pharmacological interactions, AutoDockTools 1.5.7 was used to simulate binding interactions between FTO and conventional therapeutic agents. Additionally, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer to visualize the frequency and co-occurrence of FTO-related terms, thereby helping to map research trends and knowledge gaps in the field. FTO regulates gene expression by modulating RNA methylation, particularly through the demethylation of N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), thereby influencing RNA splicing, stability, and translation. This regulatory activity plays a major role in processes such as inflammation and fibrosis. Dysregulation of FTO has been implicated in several non-malignant diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. Computational docking studies showed that FTO exhibited strong binding affinity with two drugs and moderate affinity with eight others. Bibliometric analysis revealed high-frequency keywords and visualized research hotspots pertaining to FTO, providing valuable insight into current areas of scientific interest and potential future directions of study. FTO functions as a key epigenetic regulator in non-cancerous diseases and represents a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. Our findings underscore the importance of FTO-drug interactions and suggest that small-molecule FTO modulators may hold therapeutic value for managing a variety of non-oncologic conditions.",2025,"['##besity', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto']",['fto']
Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 3 orchestrates glucocorticoid signaling to facilitate chromatin remodeling during murine adipogenesis.,"Elevated glucocorticoid levels are common in conditions such as aging, chronic stress, Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid therapy. While glucocorticoids suppress inflammation through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), they also cause metabolic side effects. Investigating alternative pathways beyond GR activation is crucial for reducing these side effects. Our phosphoproteomics analysis revealed that glucocorticoid exposure promotes phosphorylation at the RxxS motifs of multiple proteins in preadipocytes, including those mediated by serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 3 (SGK3). SGK3 is a key mediator of glucocorticoid-induced adipogenesis, as shown by impaired adipogenesis after SGK3 inhibition or genetic ablation. Sgk3-KO mice were resistant to obesity induced by glucocorticoid or a high-fat diet, and proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC) targeting SGK3 reduced adipogenesis in both obese mice and in a thyroid eye disease cell line. Mechanistically, SGK3 translocated to the nucleus upon glucocorticoid stimulation, interacted with and phosphorylated the BRG1 subunit of the BAF complex, and prevented BRG1 degradation, promoting chromatin remodeling necessary for adipogenesis. These findings highlight SGK3 as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate metabolic side effects of elevated glucocorticoid levels.",2025,"['glucocorticoid receptor', 'gr', 'gr', 'serum - and glucocorticoid - induced kinase 3', 'sgk3', 'sgk3', 'sgk3', 'sgk3', 'sgk3', 'sgk3', 'brg1 subunit', 'baf complex', 'brg1', 'sgk3']","['glucocorticoid receptor', 'sgk3', 'brg1']"
Cardiac sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) contributes to heart failure in a mouse model of diabetic cardiomyopathy.,"Diabetes mellitus can lead to a cardiomyopathy independent of other risk factors such as coronary artery disease and hypertension, in up to 75% of patients. The prevalence of diabetic cardiomyopathy in the population is 1.1%. We previously showed that SGLT1 is expressed in cardiomyocytes and is further upregulated in diabetic cardiomyopathy and other forms of heart failure. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which cardiac SGLT1 contributes to the pathophysiology of heart failure in diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. We determined whether transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of SGLT1 (TG<sup>SGLT1-DOWN</sup>) had attenuation of cardiomyopathy after induction of obesity and insulin resistance by exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) from ages 8-28 weeks. TG<sup>SGLT1-DOWN</sup> mice and wildtype (WT) littermates exhibited similar increases in body weight and blood glucose after exposure to HFD. Nevertheless, TG<sup>SGLT1-DOWN</sup> mice exhibited attenuation of cardiomyopathy, manifested by less hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (Nox2) activation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In vivo hyperinsulinemia and in vitro exposure of cardiomyocytes to high glucose or insulin led to an increase in SGLT1 expression by increasing binding of the transcription factors HNF-1 and Sp1 to the SGLT1 gene (Slc5a1), and the transcript stabilizer HuR to SGLT1 mRNA. SGLT1 may contribute to cardiac injury in obesity and insulin resistance by stimulating ROS through its interaction with EGFR.

Progress in Investigating the Impact of Obesity on Male Reproductive Function.,"Obesity represents a significant global public health challenge, which not only elevates the risk of mortality but also increases the likelihood of chronic diseases. The ongoing obesity epidemic has led to a growing recognition of the detrimental effects of excessive adipose tissue accumulation on male reproductive health. Substantial evidence indicates that obesity adversely affects sperm quality, thereby impairing male fertility. Specifically, obesity is associated with compromised spermatogenesis, erectile dysfunction, and detrimental effects on offspring fertility parameters. These effects are mediated through various mechanisms, including alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, inflammation within the reproductive system, localized caloric excess in reproductive tissues, epigenetic modifications, disruptions in gut microbiota, and heightened oxidative stress levels. While the molecular alterations associated with obesity have been extensively documented, the precise mechanisms by which obesity influences male reproductive function remain inadequately understood.

Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of age-related ocular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A target trial emulation study.,"<h4>Aims</h4>Chronic ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are leading causes of vision loss in older adults. While sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are widely prescribed in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), their effects on ocular disease risk remain largely unknown.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study evaluated the association between SGLT2i use and the risk of AMD and other age-related ocular conditions in adults aged ≥60 with T2DM, using a target trial emulation framework based on the TriNetX global health research network (2013-2025). Patients initiating SGLT2i or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) were propensity-matched 1:1. Primary outcomes were incident non-exudative, exudative, and atrophic AMD, and secondary outcomes included cataract, ocular hypertension, and primary open-angle glaucoma.<h4>Results</h4>In 12 156 matched patients, SGLT2i use was associated with significantly lower risks of non-exudative AMD (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.49-0.84) and exudative AMD (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.33-0.96) compared with DPP4i use. A slight increase in the risk of cataract was observed (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.15), while no significant differences were found for atrophic AMD, ocular hypertension, or glaucoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest that SGLT2i may offer retinal protective effects in older adults with T2DM, supporting further mechanistic and prospective clinical studies.",2025,"['sodium - glucose co - transporter 2', 'sglt2i', 's', '##glt2i', 's', '##glt2', 'dipeptidyl peptidase - 4', 's', '##glt2i', 's', '##glt2i']",['dipeptidyl peptidase 4']

Tolerability and Adverse Effects in a Specialized Heart Failure Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy Optimization Program.,"<h4>Background</h4>Utilization of heart failure (HF) guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to target doses is suboptimal, with studies citing adverse effects (AEs), physiological factors, and therapeutic inertia as potential contributing factors. The objective of our study was to explore tolerability and GDMT titration-limiting AEs in a specialized heart failure optimization program implemented at our institution.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied the baseline characteristics of 254 patients who successfully completed our program and analyzed the frequency and severity of the four most common GDMT-related AEs: hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction.<h4>Results</h4>Patients who achieved target doses were younger, more likely to have nonischemic HF, less likely to have a recent HF-related hospitalization, had less coronary artery disease, and were more likely to be obese. Multivariate analyses revealed significant associations between beta blocker suboptimal dosing (< 50% of target dose) and older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.07; p = 0.031), presence of atrial fibrillation (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.18-5.58; p = 0.017), and absence of hypertension (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.17-0.89; p = 0.025). For angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, suboptimal dosing was associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.04-4.17; p = 0.039). Of the patients who completed the program, 59.1% encountered at least one AE that hindered the titration to target GDMT doses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings highlight the complexities of GDMT optimization within a specialized program and the need for standardized definitions of GDMT-related AEs and management strategies.",2025,"['angiotensin converting enzyme', 'angiotensin ii receptor', 'angiotensin receptor neprilysin']",['angiotensin converting enzyme']

"Regional anesthesia in obese patients: Challenges, considerations, and solutions.","The increasing global prevalence of obesity has significant implications for anesthesiologists, particularly in the context of regional anesthesia. Anesthesiologists face numerous challenges during anesthesia in obese patients, including compromised respiratory function, altered pharmacokinetics of local anesthetics, and difficulties in identifying anatomical landmarks. Obesity often leads to reduced respiratory reserve, increased risk of hypoventilation, and conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which increase the likelihood of postoperative complications. Additionally, altered body composition in obese patients affects the distribution of local anesthetics, requiring adjustments in dosing based on lean body weight rather than total body weight. Furthermore, excess adipose tissue complicates the identification of anatomical landmarks and the use of ultrasound for regional block procedures, as the increased tissue depth and reduced image resolution hinder needle placement. Proper positioning, the use of low-frequency transducers, and harmonic imaging techniques are essential for optimizing ultrasound guidance. Additionally, the use of longer needles and the application of trigonometric calculations based on ultrasound scans can help determine the appropriate needle length. To overcome these challenges, anesthesiologists should adopt strategies that involve adjusting drug dosages, utilizing specialized equipment, and continuously monitoring patients for potential complications.

One microeconomic intervention approach that has been studied is the increase of the cost of SSBs through SSB taxes. This study aims to apply the augmented synthetic control method (ASCM) within a target trial framework to estimate the impact of a 1-cent-per-ounce SSB tax on obesity prevalence in California.<h4>Methods</h4>We used 2012-2020 data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS)'s AskCHIS Neighborhood Edition (AskCHIS NE) and the American Community Survey (ACS). The outcome of interest was obesity prevalence at the city level for people aged 18 and older. The estimated effect of the policy was calculated as the difference between the observed outcome in each soda tax city in the post-policy period and the predicted outcome in the synthetic controls in the post-policy period. The causal estimand of interest was the average treatment effect among the treated (ATT). We adjusted for sex, age, employment status, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, poverty, household median income, population size, and percentage of people who took public transportation to work.<h4>Results</h4>Relative to not implementing a soda tax, the mean difference in obesity prevalence three years after the implementation of a soda tax was -5.5 (95%CI -34.9 to 21.1) percentage points (pp) in Berkeley, -1.7 (95%CI, -11.3 to 6.8) pp in Albany, -1.0 (95%CI, -6.5 to 4.3) pp in Oakland, and 2.6 (-11.0 to 16.8) pp in San Francisco. Overall, the mean difference in obesity prevalence was -1.4 (95%CI, -9.2 to 5.7) pp.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, we illustrated the use of the augmented synthetic control methodology within a target trial framework with group-level longitudinal data. Our estimates of the impact of SSB tax policy on the obesity prevalence in California were imprecise.",2025,[],[]
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for predicting drug-drug interactions perpetrated by posaconazole in healthy subjects with normal weight and obesity: Concomitant use and washout.,"Posaconazole is an effective broad-spectrum triazole antifungal used as prophylaxis or to treat invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections in adults and pediatric patients. Posaconazole is a known strong inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) and substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may lead to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) when co-administered with CYP3A4-sensitive substrates and warrants modified dosing of sensitive drugs when administered concomitantly with posaconazole. Given the long elimination half-life of posaconazole (26-35 h), there is the potential for DDIs caused by posaconazole after discontinuing the antifungal. Our clinical studies revealed that the half-life of posaconazole is significantly prolonged in subjects with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which may put this population at an increased risk of DDIs after stopping posaconazole. This manuscript describes the development, verification, and validation of a whole-body, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model which describes the concomitant use and washout DDIs of posaconazole delayed-release tablet (DRT) with victim drugs ranolazine and lurasidone in healthy volunteers of normal weight and with obesity. The key findings of this model are 1) the half-life of posaconazole is significantly prolonged in patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 2) the mechanism of inhibition of CYP3A4 by posaconazole appears to be irreversible in vivo. This model may be used moving forward to assess the potential for washout DDIs with CYP3A4-sensitive substrates during concomitant use with, and after discontinuing posaconazole in subjects with normal weight and obesity.",2025,"['cytochrome p4503a4', 'cyp3a4', 'p - glycoprotein', 'p - gp', 'cyp3a4', 'cyp3a4', 'cyp3a4']","['cyp3a4', 'p glycoprotein']"
Obesity-induced left atrial dysfunction across age groups and cardiovascular conditions: a comprehensive review of diagnostic advances and clinical implications.,"Obesity is a global health concern, affecting nearly half of the world's population and significantly increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Among various cardiac impacts, left atrial (LA) dysfunction is a notable complication, especially given its association with atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and diastolic dysfunction. This comprehensive review synthesizes findings from studies across age groups, from children to adults, evaluating obesity-induced alterations in LA structure and function. Using advanced diagnostic tools like speckle tracking echocardiography, we examine the impact of obesity on LA function, the potential reversibility of LA dysfunction, and implications for CVD progression. Studies show that elevated body mass index (BMI) correlates with LA enlargement, increased stiffness, and impaired reservoir and conduit strain, with specific changes observed across different cardiovascular conditions. In children, obesity-related insulin resistance is associated with increased LA stiffness, marking early indicators of metabolic and cardiac dysfunction. In adults, higher BMI independently reduces LA strain, compromising function and raising the likelihood of AF recurrence post-cardioversion or percutaneous interventions. Additionally, clinical manifestations such as exercise intolerance in obese HFpEF patients highlight LA stiffness as a predictor of poorer quality of life and reduced physical capacity. Importantly, weight loss interventions, including bariatric surgery, show promise in reversing LA dysfunction, suggesting a potential for reducing obesity-related cardiac risks. Our review underscores the value of incorporating LA strain metrics in routine cardiac assessments to identify subclinical changes early and guide preventive strategies in obese patients. Further research into therapeutic approaches targeting LA function is essential for reducing HFpEF incidence and improving cardiovascular outcomes in obesity.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']

Muscle in Endocrinology: From Skeletal Muscle Hormone Regulation to Myokine Secretion and Its Implications in Endocrine-Metabolic Diseases.,"Skeletal muscle, traditionally recognized for its motor function, has emerged as a key endocrine organ involved in metabolic regulation and interorgan communication. This narrative review addresses the dual role of muscle as a target tissue for classical hormones-such as growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), thyroid hormones, and sex steroids-and as a source of myokines, bioactive peptides released in response to muscle contraction that exert autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects. Several relevant myokines are discussed, such as irisin and Metrnl-like myokines (Metrnl), which mediate exercise-associated metabolic benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, induction of thermogenesis in adipose tissue, and immunometabolic modulations. It also examines how muscle endocrine dysfunction, caused by chronic inflammation, hormone resistance, or sedentary lifestyle, contributes to the development and progression of metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sarcopenia, highlighting the importance of muscle mass in the prognosis of these pathologies. Finally, the therapeutic potential of interventions aimed at preserving or enhancing muscle function-through physical exercise, hormone therapy and anabolic agents-is highlighted, together with the growing research on myokines as biomarkers and pharmacological targets. This review expands the understanding of muscle in endocrinology, proposing an integrative approach that recognizes its central role in metabolic health and its potential to innovate the clinical management of endocrine-metabolic diseases.",2025,"['growth hormone', 'gh', 'insulin - like growth factor type 1', 'igf - 1', 'irisin', 'metrnl - like myokines', 'metrnl', 'insulin']","['growth hormone', 'irisin', 'metrnl', 'insulin']"
Muscle Biomarkers as Molecular Signatures for Early Detection and Monitoring of Muscle Health in Aging.,"Maintaining muscle health is essential for preserving mobility, independence, and quality of life with age. As muscle mass and function decline, the risk of frailty, chronic disease, and disability increases. Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, is a major contributor to these adverse outcomes in older adults. Early identification and monitoring of sarcopenia are critical for timely intervention to prevent irreversible decline. Muscle biomarkers offer a promising approach for detecting muscle deterioration and guiding treatment strategies. This review explores key biomarkers-including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), myostatin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), irisin, interleukin 15 (IL-15), and procollagen type III <i>N</i>-terminal propeptide (P3NP)-that reflect underlying processes such as muscle anabolism, inflammation, metabolism, and remodeling. Alterations in these markers are associated with muscle health status. Furthermore, hormonal status, biological sex, and nutritional factors all modulate biomarker levels, emphasizing the need for personalized assessments. Integrating biomarker analysis into clinical practice has the potential to enhance early diagnosis, inform personalized interventions, and ultimately promote healthy aging by maintaining muscle function and reducing disability risk.",2025,"['insulin - like growth factor 1', 'igf - 1', 'myostatin', 'interleukin - 6', 'il - 6', 'irisin', 'interleukin 15', 'il - 15', 'procollagen type iii']","['insulin like growth factor 1', 'myostatin', 'interleukin 6', 'irisin', 'interleukin 15']"
Immunometabolic Interactions in Obesity: Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.,"Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation that triggers chronic low-grade inflammation and systemic immune dysregulation, significantly increasing the risk of metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This review examines the bidirectional relationship between obesity and immune dysfunction, focusing on how immune cell infiltration in adipose tissue drives inflammatory processes. We highlight the phenotypic shifts in key immune populations-macrophages polarized toward proinflammatory M1 phenotypes, T cell exhaustion occurrs, and alterations appear in B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells-that collectively contribute to metabolic deterioration. The gut microbiome emerged as a critical mediator in this relationship, influencing both immune responses and metabolic regulation through gut-liver and gut-brain axes. We explore emerging immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies, including anti-inflammatory agents, microbiota interventions, and targeted immune therapies such as innovative nanomedicine approaches. The review also addresses the challenges of immunotherapy in obesity, particularly the paradoxical effects observed in cancer immunotherapy outcomes and the need for personalized treatment approaches. Artificial intelligence is highlighted as a potential tool to enhance patient stratification and treatment optimization in future immunomodulatory interventions. Understanding these immunometabolic interactions provides a foundation for developing more effective therapeutic strategies that could transform obesity management and reduce the burden of obesity-related metabolic diseases.",2025,[],[]

Targeting iNAMPT and NAD Biosynthesis to Break the Obesity-Associated Liver Cancer Link.,"<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Obesity is linked to liver cancer through metabolic mechanisms and can promote tumor growth through metabolic impairment, decreased lipid metabolism, and interference of the energy balance in the liver. NAMPT is an enzyme expressed in the liver and is involved in the progression of tumors in obesogenic environments, while iNAMPT is known to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of NAD, an essential coenzyme involved in ATP synthesis which promotes a pro-growth environment in the context of obesity. Because iNAMPT and cellular energetics, a hallmark of cancer, play an important role in liver cancer progression, it has become a target for cancer therapies focused on inhibiting its functions. The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of NAD biosynthesis in obesity-associated liver cancer progression. <b>Methods</b>: Cell culture studies were conducted with serum from male mice randomized to diet-induced obesity (OB) or control (CR) ± FK866 (iNAMPT inhibitor) in SNU, HepG2 human liver cancer cells, and Hepa 1-6 liver murine cells. Protein analysis of pAkt and pErk was performed via immunoblot. Cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell viability, and invasion were also measured in the cells. For the mouse model, the C57BL/6J male mice were randomized to the DIO or CR group. At 21 weeks of age, the mice were injected subcutaneously with Hepa 1-6 liver cancer cells. At 23 weeks, the mice received an I.P. injection of FK866 (30 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. The tumor and mouse weights were measured. <b>Results</b>: The cells exposed to OB sera showed increased proliferation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) secretion, ROS, and invasion. FK866 decreased proliferation, LDH secretion, ROS, and invasion for all liver cancer cells. The cells exposed to CR sera and OB + FK866 resulted in more LDH, suggesting increased apoptosis compared with OB sera. The OB sera increased phosphorylation of Akt, which was suppressed by FK866 compared with the OB group. In liver cancer cells, physiological and cellular signaling is affected differently when inhibiting NAD biosynthesis in an in vitro model of obesity and liver cancer. In vivo, the diet-induced obese (DIO) mice weighed significantly more than the mice fed a control diet. In addition, 70% of the DIO mice developed tumors, compared with 20% of the CR mice, and had tumors with greater volumes and weights. NAD inhibition blocked obesity-induced tumor growth. <b>Conclusions</b>: In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of iNAMPT resulted in suppression of tumor growth in the context of obesity. Identifying pre-clinical strategies to reverse the impact of obesity on liver cancer progression is important due to the strong increased risk of liver cancer and its poor prognosis. Future translational research studies can be built from this pre-clinical foundational research.",2025,"['nampt', 'inampt', 'nad', 'inampt', 'nad', 'inampt', 'pakt', 'perk', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'ldh', 'ldh', 'ldh', 'akt', 'inampt']","['nampt', 'nad', 'perk', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'ldh', 'akt']"
State of the Art Review: Thiazide diuretics exploit the endocannabinoid system via NAPE-PLD.,"The present State of the Art Review will take stock of targeting the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the management of hypertension and vascular diseases. Major efforts have been made in the last thirty years to develop compounds modulating the ECS for diseases, both in the central and peripheral tissues. Agonists of the cannabinoid receptor CB1 elicited hypotension but were at strong risks of inducing tachycardia, heart and kidney damage. The clinical translation of CB2 agonists as well as anti-obesity CB1 blockers, proposed as promising treatments for cardiovascular risk factors, were complicated by adverse side effects. Inhibitors of the membrane enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide normalized elevated blood pressure, at least in hypertensive rats. The turning point came when we discovered the phospholipase NAPE-PLD as a systemic target of thiazide diuretics, revealing physicians have indeed targeted the ECS for over sixty years in clinics, unknowingly. The membrane-associated target promotes diuretic effect through its internal channel and generates at the same time anandamide and other lipid signaling amides that exert marked protective actions, useful for the chronic treatment of hypertension. Results have extended our knowledge of the mechanism of thiazide medications, rationalizing both their acute and chronic therapeutic effects. The stabilization of NAPE-PLD by chemical agents that bind to the thiazide-binding site is efficacious in the treatment of hypertension and vascular resistance, providing a validated approach in clinics for the ECS modulation in human diseases associated with neurovascular alterations.",2025,"['cannabinoid receptor cb1', 'cb2', 'cb1', 'fatty acid amide hydrolase', 'f', '##aah', 'phospholipase', 'nape - pld', 'nape - pld']","['cannabinoid receptor cb1', 'cb2', 'cb1', 'fatty acid amide hydrolase', 'phospholipase']"
Understanding the association of longitudinal body mass index patterns in children and their parents: A data-driven study from the TARGet Kids! cohort.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity remains a persistent global health issue across generations. Targeting family-level factors may help improve child and adolescent body mass index (BMI) outcomes. While associations between parental and offspring BMI are well-documented, the temporal patterns and risk factors driving these relationships remain unclear. This study aimed to identify longitudinal family-level BMI patterns incorporating child, maternal, and paternal BMI and apply interpretable machine learning (ML) methods to uncover key predictors.<h4>Methods</h4>This longitudinal study included 6092 children and their parents from the TARGet Kids! cohort, with BMI measurements collected from birth to 150 months. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling identified joint trajectories of child BMI-for-age Z-scores (zBMI) and parental BMI. Five ML classifiers predicted group membership using 78 predictors spanning sociodemographic, dietary, parental health, and child lifestyle variables. To explore the modifying effect of parental overweight/obesity (OW/OB) on the relationship between child age and BMI, Bayesian generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with smoothed term interactions were applied.<h4>Results</h4>Five distinct joint trajectory groups were identified. Children in the highest BMI trajectory group typically had both parents following similar high BMI trajectories. Parental OW/OB status emerged as the strongest predictor of child OW/OB (37 % classification probability), followed by breastfeeding duration (17 %) and child physical activity (15 %). The influence of parental OW/OB was particularly pronounced in early childhood (0-60 months). Bayesian GAMMs confirmed the robust, longitudinal association between child and parental BMI trajectories.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Parental BMI patterns strongly influence child BMI development, with age-dependent effects. These findings highlight the importance of early family-based interventions.",2025,[],[]
Targeted intervention in obesity-associated atrial fibrosis using nanoparticle-loaded fusion protein.,"The association between obesity and atrial fibrillation (AF) has garnered increasing attention. Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and promotes the occurrence of AF through multiple mechanisms. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced AF using GLP-1R/GIPR dual-target agonist fusion protein (Fc) loaded into adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) exosome-liposome hybrid nanoparticles (LE@Fc NPs). We successfully constructed and purified the Fc, verifying its purity and functional activity through SDS-PAGE and UV absorption spectroscopy. The fusion protein was then loaded into nanovesicles, and their morphology, size, and stability were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). In vitro experiments demonstrated that LE@Fc NPs exhibit high fusion efficiency and targeted delivery capability. In vivo experimental results show that LE@Fc NPs significantly inhibit ferroptosis in the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) of obese mice (iron content: 3.69 ± 0.36 vs. 0.88 ± 0.09), by restoring GSH levels (0.45 ± 0.08 vs. 0.87 ± 0.08) and Gpx4 expression (0.32 ± 0.06 vs. 1.01 ± 0.16), and reducing ROS (12.01 ± 0.95 vs. 2.68 ± 0.17), MDA (3.17 ± 0.29 vs. 0.95 ± 0.09), and 4-HNE (3.74 ± 0.51 vs. 0.91 ± 0.09) levels. Furthermore, LE@Fc NPs treatment significantly improved the inflammatory response (IL-1β: 44.08 ± 3.74 vs. 12.07 ± 0.65, IL-6: 515.59 ± 47.70 vs. 288.43 ± 16.81, MCP-1: 1401.04 ± 194.88 vs. 600.28 ± 45.54, TNF-α: 39.96 ± 2.48 vs. 18.01 ± 0.85). LE@Fc NPs also reduced atrial fibrosis, thereby effectively lowering the incidence of AF. Echocardiography and electrocardiogram monitoring revealed that LE@Fc NPs treatment significantly improved atrial remodeling and reduced the occurrence of AF in obese mice. In addition, LE@Fc NPs significantly improved obesity-induced systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders. In conclusion, LE@Fc NPs show great potential for the treatment of obesity-related AF.",2025,"['g', '##lp - 1r', 'gipr', 'fc', 'gsh', 'gpx4', 'il - 1β', 'il - 6', 'mcp - 1', 'tnf - α']","['gipr', 'gsh', 'gpx4']"
"Obesity and Its Comorbidities: Current Treatment Options, Emerging Biological Mechanisms, Future Perspectives and Challenges.","Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial disease and a major global public health challenge. Defined by excessive fat accumulation, obesity significantly increases the risk of numerous diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, contributing to rising morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Although several pharmacological treatments have demonstrated notable efficacy in weight management, concerns regarding drug safety remain a significant challenge. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) has emerged as the most effective intervention for achieving long-term and sustained weight loss; however, it is typically reserved for advanced stages of the disease. Moreover, the role of MBS in managing obesity-related comorbidities remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the epidemiology of obesity and its associated comorbidities, along with the latest insights into the mechanisms underlying obesity-induced chronic complications. Growing evidence highlights the crucial role of imbalances between white and brown adipose tissues, alterations in gut microbiota, genetic and epigenetic modifications, and immune system dysregulation in driving obesity and its related conditions. These emerging insights have unveiled numerous potential therapeutic targets with promising weight-reducing effects. Furthermore, advancements in our understanding of signal transduction pathways may pave the way for future multimodal therapeutic strategies in obesity management, ushering in a new era of precision medicine.",2025,[],[]

Epidemiology of Overweight and Obesity in Early Childhood in China and Associated Factors.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the epidemiological landscape and identify the risk factors associated with overweight and obesity in early childhood in China.<h4>Methods</h4>We collected measurements of weight and height and calculated the body mass index (BMI) for preschool children. The overweight and obesity status of children aged 2 to 6 years was examined using the 2005 China BMI growth chart. WHO weight-for-length (WFL) charts were used to identify those at risk for early childhood overweight. Data on potential risk factors for childhood overweight/obesity were obtained through questionnaires. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between risk factors and overweight/obesity.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 13,896 participants, 7.5% of infants and toddlers were overweight, 18.4% of preschoolers were overweight, and 10.3% of preschoolers were obese. The prevalence of obesity among preschool boys (12.6%) was significantly greater than that among preschool girls (7.7%, p<0.001). Our analysis identified nine risk factors significantly associated with an increased risk of early childhood overweight or obesity. These include guardian status, paternal height, frequency of weekly candy consumption, maternal weight, leg circumference, waist circumference, age at the onset of overweight, age group, and maternal education level. In addition, children born to overweight mothers had a 1.02-fold higher likelihood of being overweight/obese compared to children with mothers of normal weight (95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.03; p=0.0106). Upon adjustment for all potentially confounding variables, the odds ratios for the frequency of weekly candy consumption in children were negatively linked to overweight/obesity (0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.00). In addition, gender-dietary habit interactions significantly influenced the risk of overweight/obesity in both positive and negative directions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our research on the prevalence and predictors of overweight/obesity in preschool children underscores the importance of recognizing and understanding early childhood obesity within its context. Obesity prevention efforts should target key risk factors, such as parental obesity and unhealthy early childhood lifestyles.",2025,[],[]
Mechanisms and clinical perspectives on imeglimin for insulin resistance in obese patients.,"Imeglimin, a novel oral hypoglycemic agent derived from metformin, innovatively addresses obesity-induced insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Unlike conventional therapies, Imeglimin targets key pathophysiological mechanisms, including lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation, thereby enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization in peripheral tissues. Imeglimin also promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and protects pancreatic β-cells, offering additional glucose-lowering benefits. Clinical studies, primarily conducted in Japan, have shown significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and improved IR with a favorable safety profile, including a low risk of lactic acidosis and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Imeglimin represents a paradigm shift from 'blood sugar control' to 'diabetes reversal' in treatment concepts, with its multi-target mechanism and organ-protective characteristics opening up a new era for the treatment of metabolic diseases.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'hemoglobin a1c', 'hba1c']","['insulin', 'hemoglobin a1c', 'hba1c']"
Reduction of serum lipids by liver-specific knockout of chemerin in DIO mice.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading global cause of death, with hyperlipidemia being a critical risk factor. Current lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, PCSK9 inhibitors) effectively reduce LDL-C but have limitations like side effects or residual cardiovascular risk, necessitating novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of chemerin, an adipokine, in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. Clinical analysis of 42 treatment-naive participants showed significant positive correlations between serum chemerin and triglycerides (TG, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5073, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol (TC, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.1464, p = 0.0124), and LDL-C (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.1600, p = 0.0087), independent of HDL-C. In C57BL/6J mice, exogenous chemerin administration in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity models significantly increased serum TG, TC, and LDL-C levels. Moreover, we found that the expression of chemerin was upregulated in liver (but not adipose tissues) of obese mice, which indicates that the liver is the primary source of obesity-associated chemerin. The animal experiments showed that liver-specific Rarres2 (chemerin-encoding gene) knockout via AAV9-CRISPR reduced HFD-induced elevations of serum TG, TC, and LDL-C levels. Furthermore, the results showed that liver-specific Rarres2 knockout also ameliorated hepatic injury (ALT, AST) and systemic inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6). Collectively, these findings establish chemerin as a hepatic mediator of obesity-related hyperlipidemia, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target for hyperlipidemia.",2025,"['pcsk9', 'ldl - c', 'chemerin', 'serum chemerin', 'tg', 'ldl - c', 'hdl - c', 'chemerin', 'tg', 'tc', 'ldl - c', 'chemerin', 'chemerin', 'rarres2', 'chemerin - encoding gene', 'tg', 't', 'ldl - c', 'rarres2', 'tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'chemerin']","['pcsk9', 'chemerin', 'rarres2']"
Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict Postpartum Depression from Electronic Health Records in a Tertiary Care Setting.,"<b>Background</b>: Postpartum depression is a common mental health condition that can occur up to one year after childbirth. Recent studies have increasingly used machine learning techniques to predict its occurrence; however, few have comprehensively explored the use of electronic health record data, particularly in tertiary care settings where such data can be fragmented. <b>Methods</b>: We analyzed electronic health record data from 12,284 women who delivered at The Birth Center at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, excluding those with missing data or no prenatal or postpartum visits. To define the target variable, we examined different combinations of depression screening tools (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9), along with diagnosis codes specific to postpartum depression. We then trained a random forest classification model to predict postpartum depression. <b>Results</b>: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.733 ± 0.008, which is comparable to previous studies. Adding socioeconomic features from census tract data did not improve predictive performance, underscoring the importance of individual-level data. Incorporating national survey data, such as the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, also did not improve performance due to limited overlap in data features. Interestingly, model performance was slightly lower among Hispanic patients (area under the curve = 0.713 ± 0.040), although this difference was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.17), likely due to the small sample size. A similar, but statistically significant trend was observed in the larger national survey dataset (area under the curve = 0.699 ± 0.019 for Hispanic patients versus 0.735 ± 0.010 for White patients, <i>p</i> < 0.01). <b>Conclusions</b>: While our model demonstrates moderate predictive capability, further validation and prospective testing are needed before clinical implementation. This work also identified an optimal approach for digital phenotyping postpartum depression in electronic health record data and highlighted key gaps in data quality and completeness. These findings emphasize the importance of robust data when developing predictive models for real-world clinical use.",2025,[],[]
Application of nutrition interventions with GLP-1 based therapies: A narrative review of the challenges and solutions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a heterogeneous systemic chronic disease associated with excess adiposity and a complex etiology and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. Initially used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies are now widely prescribed for individuals with overweight and obesity as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. However, despite their impressive weight reduction capabilities, many patients on GLP-1 based therapies do not receive appropriate nutrition advice and struggle to maintain their weight reduction.<h4>Methods</h4>This narrative review explores and summarizes existing literature on the challenges associated with nutrition intake in people with obesity taking GLP-1 based therapies and practical applications of nutrition and lifestyle interventions for the management of these individuals to ensure their best long-term health outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Delivering optimal nutrition management to people with obesity treated with GLP-1 based therapies presents healthcare providers with many challenges including addressing the impact of obesity and weight reduction on body composition (particularly muscle mass loss and risk of sarcopenic obesity), and poor nutrition. Physicians should work with dietitians and other healthcare providers to deliver comprehensive lifestyle counselling that is patient-centered, aligning with the needs and preferences of the individual. This should include advice on: timely and appropriate nutrition that centers on adequate macronutrient, micronutrient and fluid intake, particularly increased protein intake alongside resistance training for the preservation of muscle mass; mental health; sleep hygiene, physical activity; and medication adherence and persistence. Evidence-based nutrition guidelines can also provide an important framework for healthcare professionals, helping to ensure nutrition advice is consistent and based on rigorous scientific research.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring that patients treated with GLP-1 based therapies are closely monitored and provided with comprehensive nutrition and lifestyle support to ensure they achieve the best long-term health outcomes.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'g', '##lp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1']","['glucagon like peptide 1', 'glp 1']"
Pharmacotherapy for Obesity: Recent Updates.,"In this narrative review we describe the recent updates regarding anti-obesity medications as of February 2025. We describe the physiologic mechanisms underpinning the development of hunger, satiation, and maintenance of satiety to address targets for anti-obesity medications. The efficacy, mechanism, and additional beneficial effects of anti-obesity medications are then further detailed. For this review, we focus on FDA-approved medications for obesity and on select medications currently under development and undergoing Phase 2 and 3 trials. We start by focusing on the non-incretin anti-obesity medications orlistat, phentermine, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion. We also highlight setmelanotide for heritable obesity. The mechanism of action and comparative efficacy of the GLP-1 receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide are reviewed. Tirzepatide, the GLP-1 and GIP-receptor dual agonist is described, and weight loss is compared to alternative anti-obesity medications. Additional incretin targets in the pipeline include dual co-agonists to glucagon and GLP-1 receptors, triple agonists targeting glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP, novel GLP-1 agonists, oral formulations of GLP-1 agonists, and amylin agonists.

The percentage of time of unbound amoxicillin plasma concentration above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC) of >40%, representing bactericidal activity, was used as a PK/PD target to calculate the probability of target attainment (PTA). The PTA threshold was defined as 90% of treated individuals achieving fT > MIC ≥ 40%.<h4>Results</h4>Amoxicillin PK was best characterized by a one-compartment model including a zero-order absorption with lag time followed by a first-order absorption and linear elimination. The relative oral bioavailability in post-RYGB patients was nearly halved compared with non-obese subjects. Age exhibited a negative correlation with clearance, consistent with amoxicillin being a hydrophilic drug primarily eliminated through the kidneys. For MIC ≤ 2 mg/L, the oral dosing regimen of 1000 mg q6h reached the therapeutic target for non-obese. For MIC ≤ 1 mg/L, 1000 mg q6h is needed in obese and post-RYGB subjects.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Amoxicillin doses of 1000 mg q6h were found to maximize the probability of attaining the PK/PD target with MIC ≤ 1 mg/L in obese and post-RYGB patients.",2025,['amoxici'],[]
Orbital Fat is an Observation Model to Provide Insights into Adipocyte Hypertrophy and Hyperplasia During White Adipose Tissue Expansion.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity is a global health problem characterized by excessive white adipose tissue (WAT) distribution. Adipocyte hypertrophy (increased cell size) and hyperplasia (differentiation into new adipocytes from pre-adipocytes) are two ways for WAT to expand. The precedence of hypertrophy over hyperplasia leads to an enlarged adipocyte size, which is associated with multiple metabolic dysfunctions. Compared with abdominal subcutaneous fat (SF), orbital fat (OF) has smaller adipocytes with less inflammatory infiltration, better vascularization, and higher adipogenic and proliferative capacities, reflecting a healthy metabolic state. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can stabilize energy homeostasis via G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) to alleviate insulin resistance and inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>We used lipidomics analysis to reveal a greater accumulation of two PUFAs-arachidonic acid (AA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in OF than in SF and then hypothesized that AA/DPA is one factor regulating WAT morphological and biological heterogeneity.<h4>Results</h4>Mechanistically, the existing literature evidence suggests that AA/DPA signals may stimulate the co-activation and interaction of GPR120 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), at least partially contributing to adipose metabolic health.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As the differential metabolites between OF and SF, AA and DPA, along with the relevant GPR120/PPARγ pathways, offer new therapeutic approaches for morbid obesity.",2025,"['g protein - coupled receptor 120', 'gpr120', 'insulin', 'gpr120', 'peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ', 'pparγ', 'gpr120', 'pparγ']","['gpr120', 'insulin', 'pparγ']"
Identification of Immune Hub Genes in Obese Postmenopausal Women Using Microarray and Single-Cell RNA Seq Data.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity is characterized by a chronic state of low-grade inflammation. Investigating immune-critical genes and their biological functions in the adipose tissue of postmenopausal obese women is crucial for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of immune dysregulation associated with obesity. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, microarray (GSE151839) and single-cell RNA-seq (GSE176171) datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). For microarray data analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis, and immune infiltration analysis (ssGSEA) were employed to identify obesity-related immune-critical genes. Subsequently, the candidate genes were validated using scRNA-seq data to explore their expression patterns at the single-cell level. Finally, the expression levels of these immune-critical genes were experimentally verified in adipose tissue from obese and control zebrafish models using RT-qPCR. <b>Results:</b> Analysis of microarray data through WGCNA, PPI and ssGSEA identified 16 obesity-related immune-critical genes, including <i>IL7R</i>, <i>CD3E</i>, <i>CD2</i>, <i>CCR5</i>, <i>CD3D</i>, <i>MS4A1</i>, <i>TRAT1</i>, <i>SLAMF8</i>, <i>CCL3L1</i>, <i>SPP1</i>, <i>CCL5</i>, <i>IL2RG</i>, <i>CD3G</i>, <i>TLR8</i>, <i>ITK</i>, and <i>CCL3</i>. Differential expression of <i>SPP1</i>, <i>ITK</i> and <i>CCL5</i> was confirmed in scRNA-seq data, with <i>ITK</i> and <i>CCL5</i> showing distinct expression patterns in natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulation of <i>SPP1</i> and <i>ITK</i> in adipose tissue of obese zebrafish compared to lean controls. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study identifies <i>SPP1</i>, <i>ITK</i> and <i>CCL5</i> as key immune hub genes in the adipose tissue of postmenopausal obese women, with NK cells playing a significant role in adipose tissue inflammation through the expression of these genes.

Polymorphism of Melanocortin Receptor Genes-Association with Inflammatory Traits and Diseases.,"Melanocortin receptors (MCRs) are responsible for various functions ranging from skin pigmentation, regulation of appetite, stress response and cognition, steroid synthesis, and energy balance to cellular regeneration and immunomodulation. The genetic polymorphism with tissue distribution ranging from the brain, limbic system, and adrenal cortex to neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages is evident in MCRs. The mutations in MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, and MC4R genes are associated with risk of melanoma, familial glucocorticoid deficiency, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. Meanwhile, MC1R, MC2R, and MC5R genes are involved in the risk of major depressive disorder. Melanocortin receptors are involved in different inflammatory disorders, i.e., atopic dermatitis, autoimmune uveitis, sarcoidosis, respiratory diseases, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and reperfusion injury. Several newer therapeutic agents related to MCRs have numerous advantages over the current anti-inflammatory drugs, demonstrating therapeutic relevance. Among them, α-MSH analogs play a role in atopic dermatitis and scleroderma, and MC1R agonist Dersimelagon has shown effectiveness in systemic sclerosis. The FDA has recently approved the repository corticotropin injection (RCI) to treat sarcoidosis. The FDA has also approved various melanocortin agonists, i.e., Bremelanotide, Afamelanotide, and Setmelanotide, for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder, Erythropoietic protoporphyria, and obesity, due to pro-opiomelanocortin and leptin receptor deficiency, respectively.

Partial inhibition of adipose CIDEC improves insulin sensitivity and increases energy expenditure in high-fat diet-fed mice via activating ATGL-PPARα pathway.,"Obesity poses a significant risk for metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), yet effective treatments remain limited. Cell Death-Inducing DNA Fragmentation Factor-α-Like Effector C (CIDEC), a lipid droplet membrane protein, facilitates lipid droplet fusion and is crucial for adipose tissue expansion, making it a key target for obesity and related metabolic diseases. However, previous research revealed that complete genetic deletion of Cidec in adipose tissues, while reducing fat accumulation, induced severe insulin resistance in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, potentially due to ectopic fat storage in the liver. Given that complete knockout is an extreme approach, partial inhibition holds greater clinical relevance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of partial inhibition of CIDEC in adipose tissues on fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity in mice. Using the Cre-LoxP system, we generated adipose Cidec haploinsufficient mice. Under a standard diet, these mice exhibited normal body weight, fat accumulation, and insulin sensitivity. Notably, under HFD conditions, mice with partial Cidec deficiency showed reduced fat accumulation in adipose tissues while hepatic fat accumulation remained unchanged, accompanied by improved insulin sensitivity and increased energy expenditure. Mechanistically, we found partial Cidec deficiency activated thermogenic program in adipocytes in vivo and in vitro through the ATGL-PPARα pathway. In conclusion, adipose CIDEC partial inhibition attenuates HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance by enhancing ATGL-PPARα-mediated energy expenditure, establishing this approach as a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity and related metabolic diseases.",2025,"['insulin', 'cell death - inducing dna fragmentation factor - α - like effector c', 'cidec', 'lipid droplet membrane protein', 'cidec', 'insulin', 'cidec', 'insulin', 'cidec', 'insulin', 'cidec', 'insulin', 'cidec', 'atgl', 'pparα', 'cidec', 'insulin', 'atgl', 'pparα']","['insulin', 'cidec', 'atgl', 'pparalpha']"
Comparative Analysis of Food Addiction and Obesity: A Critical Review.,"Compulsive ingestion of tasty foods is a characteristic of food addiction (FA), a debated but increasingly recognized disorder that shares neurological features with drug-use disorders. This review examines the overlapping processes between FA and obesity, with a focus on the opioid and dopamine reward systems. Sweet, fatty, and salty processed foods dominate our brain pathways, making them increasingly less able to feel full and urge us to eat more than we require. While the diagnosis remains controversial, the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) is the most widely used assessment instrument. Potential management options include nutrition-based interventions, such as whole-food diets, and behavioral strategies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and conscious eating. However, stigmatization, labeling, and food industry promotion of addictive products pose ethical concerns. Against the backdrop of ongoing controversy, this article summarizes the highest-quality research available on the neurological basis of FA as well as its measurement challenges and possible therapeutic options. The public health implications of FA and obesity can be lessened by future research to explore personalized treatments, refine diagnostic systems, and inform policy.",2025,[],[]
"Implementation research on the intervention mode of ""Comorbidity-Co-causes-Joint-prevention"" comprehensive demonstration district of depression and obesity among children and adolescents in Beijing: study protocol.","<h4>Background</h4>Depression and obesity among adolescents have become major public health problems. They have common biological mechanisms and overlapping risk factors, such as lack of exercise, poor diet, and sleep disorders. Although there are corresponding interventions for these two diseases, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and systematic intervention approach to address their coexistence. The study will integrate existing intervention strategies and develop various intervention measures at individual, family, school, and medical institution levels. The aMOST and SCA framework will be employed to provide personalized and effective treatment for adolescents. Following its implementation, the comprehensive intervention strategy will undergo evaluation using the RE-AIM framework and will be promoted through online public accounts and academic conferences.  METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This research on adolescent depression and obesity will comprise three. First, a comprehensive intervention strategy will be developed based on the aMOST model through screening, optimizing, and refining phases. Second, the intervention will be implemented using the SCA in three steps: cross-sectional study for screening, cluster randomized controlled trial for high-risk students, and clinical referral. Third, the strategy will be evaluated and promoted based on the RE-AIM framework. Quality control will be ensured in both development and implementation phases. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel2016, SPSS, and R for different phases of the study. Count data will be described with percentages and compared using χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact probability test and measurement data was characterized by mean, median, etc., and compared using MMRM, t-tests, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests.  DISCUSSION: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention strategy and examine its implementation within families, schools, and medical institutions. Following this intervention research, the comprehensive intervention program targeting adolescent depression and obesity holds immense potential in China, as it can facilitate and support changes to healthy lifestyle behaviors, thereby reducing the risks of adolescent depression and obesity.  TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06489990.",2025,[],[]
"High-fat diet-induced adipose tissue-resident macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells modulate chronic inflammation and adipogenesis during obesity.","<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is one of the major healthcare challenges and socio-economic liabilities worldwide and is rapidly reaching pandemic proportions. Characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (AT), the development of obesity is influenced by genetic, neurologic, and metabolic factors, immune activation, and behavioral activities. During obesity, AT macrophages play a central role in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function in adipocytes. In this study, we investigated how AT resident macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) communicate to coordinate and regulate AT inflammation during obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed contact mode <i>ex-vivo</i> co-culture of different combinations of AT resident immune cells from mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and normal diet (ND) and also 3T3-L1 adipocytes with macrophages, T cells, and DCs isolated from AT of mice fed HFD. We analyzed the expression of adiposity-associated genes, inflammatory markers, and levels of cytokines and chemokine in conditioned culture medium. We also analyzed adipogenesis and performed Oil Red O staining of co-cultured adipocytes to visualize lipid accumulation under these conditions.<h4>Results</h4>We found that macrophages from AT derived from HFD-fed mice fueled adipogenesis and inflammation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction cells derived from ND AT. Macrophages from HFD AT also promoted the expression in ND-derived T cells of chemokines including CCL5 and CXCL10 and inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-17A. Interestingly, T cells from HFD AT also induced expression of inflammatory genes in ND macrophages and lipid accumulation and expression of inflammatory proteins like CXCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. DCs also stimulated adipocyte differentiation, and expression of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines like CCL5, MCP-3, and TNF-α in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings suggest that during obesity, macrophages work together in a coordinated fashion to modulate the activities of T cells, stimulating adipocyte differentiation, and thereby sustaining chronic inflammation. Thus, macrophages in AT might serve as druggable targets in combatting obesity.",2025,"['ccl5', 'cxcl10', 'tnf - α', 'il - 1β', 'ifn - γ', 'il - 17a', 'cxcl2', 'ccl3', 'ccl4', 'ccl5', 'mcp - 3', 'tnf - α']","['ccl5', 'cxcl10', 'cxcl2', 'ccl3', 'ccl4']"
"Arctiin, a lignan compound, enhances adipose tissue browning and energy expenditure by activating the adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.","<h4>Background</h4>The activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity. Arctiin (ARC), a lignan compound known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and hypoglycemic properties, has not been fully elucidated regarding its effects and mechanisms on obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>In the present study, we established both high-fat diet-induced obese mouse models and mature adipocyte cultures to comprehensively investigate the therapeutic effects of ARC on obesity. Systemic energy metabolism and thermogenic capacity were assessed through metabolic cage monitoring and cold stimulation tests. Histopathological alterations in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, while key gene expression in adipocytes was determined by Western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ARC's anti-obesity effects, we employed an integrated approach combining network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking simulations, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and WB to identify potential molecular targets and delineate the associated signaling pathways modulated by ARC treatment.<h4>Results</h4>In diet-induced obese mice, ARC administration at doses of 20 and 60 mg/kg/day ameliorated metabolic dysfunction through enhanced WAT browning and increased energy expenditure. In C3H10T1/2-induced adipocytes, ARC upregulated the protein expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), and other brown-specific marker genes, promoting mitochondrial function and browning of adipocytes. Mechanistically, our findings suggest that ARC may promote adipocyte browning via the A<sub>2A</sub>R-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, ARC exerts protective effects against obesity by promoting the browning of white adipocytes and holds promise as a potentially beneficial therapeutic agent for the treatment of obesity.",2025,"['arctiin', 'arc', 'arc', 'arc', 'arc', 'arc', 'arc', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 - alpha', 'pgc - 1α', 'arc', '##p (', 'protein kinase a', 'pka', 'arc']","['arctiin', 'arc', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha', 'protein kinase a', 'pka']"

We explore PVAT's molecular interactions in obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, elucidating its contribution to inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Advanced imaging techniques, notably the perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) and circulating biomarkers, are highlighted for early CVD detection. Novel therapeutic strategies, including lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and gut microbiota modulation, are discussed.

Cardiovascular risk factors and modern therapeutic strategies in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes to prevent future diabetic angiopathy in the era of innovative miRNAs biomarkers.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children is a serious, chronic, incurable disease associated with the frequent and early occurrence of additional, well-known cardiovascular risk factors and exacerbation of the risk of future cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Lately, accumulating evidence suggests that exosomal miRNAs play a major role not only in the pathophysiology of T1D but also in its late complications. Since premature CVD is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetes, considerable efforts have been made to define the molecular and pathological features and to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Dysregulation of the expression or function of various miRNAs may affect angiogenesis, vascular inflammation, or cardiac remodeling, which play key roles in the development and progression of cardiovascular complications. While CVD usually appear in adulthood, pathology and early markers may appear during adolescence, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and prevention in this age group. In this narrative review, we aimed to summarize the latest findings on miRNAs and their role as biomarkers of cardiovascular risk factors and subsequent complications in children with T1D, presenting promising candidates for clinical applications.",2025,[],[]
Distinct somatic mutation profiles in colon cancer by behavioral comorbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Tobacco use, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for colorectal cancer, but whether they generate distinct tumor mutation patterns is unclear. Tobacco is a known mutagen, while obesity and diabetes may act through metabolic and inflammatory pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed colon cancer patients from the University of California Health Data Warehouse, linking clinical sequencing data to diagnosis-based indicators of tobacco dependence, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. For each gene-behavior pair, we conducted reverse logistic regressions and calculated a combined score reflecting the strength and specificity of association adjusting for demographic covariates and cancer stage. Multidimensional scaling and clustering assessed behavioral differentiation.<h4>Results</h4>Of 981 gene-behavior tests, 87 pairs exhibited a behavioral association at <i>p</i> < 0.001 in adjusted models. Of these, 60 tobacco, 12 obesity, and 9 diabetes pairs had affinity ≥0.5; 48 tobacco pairs exceeded 1.0.

Adipose tissue macrophage-derived miR-690 modulates adipocyte precursor cell maintenance and adipogenesis.,"Obesity is intricately linked to various metabolic diseases; however, some individuals maintain metabolic health despite being classified as obese. A critical factor underlying this paradox is the expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT), which can occur through two mechanisms: hypertrophy (the enlargement of existing fat cells) and hyperplasia (the formation of new fat cells from adipocyte precursor cells, or APCs). Hyperplasia is regarded as a healthier mode of WAT expansion, as it tends to reduce inflammation and protect against insulin resistance. Thus, interventions that promote hyperplasia over hypertrophy could improve metabolic health in obese individuals. In this study, we investigate the role of microRNA-690 (miR-690), an anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing molecule, in maintaining the APC population and facilitating the healthy expansion of epididymal WAT (eWAT). Our findings indicate that in lean mice, macrophages support the APC population by transferring miR-690 to APCs. However, during obesity, the recruitment of pro-inflammatory lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) to eWAT diminishes miR-690 delivery to APCs, impairing adipogenesis and leading to unhealthy WAT expansion. We demonstrate that strategies aimed at increasing the availability of miR-690 to APCs or mimicking its effects can restore APC functionality. Additionally, mutations in Nadk, the target of miR-690, were shown to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on APC maintenance in eWAT. These findings suggest that targeting the miR-690-Nadk axis in APCs may provide novel therapeutic strategies to promote healthy adipose tissue expansion and protect against obesity-related metabolic diseases.",2025,"['insulin', 'microrna - 690', 'mir - 690', 'insulin', 'mir - 690', 'e', 'mir - 690', 'mir - 690', 'a', 'nadk', 'mir - 690', 'mir - 690', 'nadk']","['insulin', 'nadk']"
"Predictors of Weight Reduction in a Multidisciplinary Community Program for Children with Overweight and Obesity: A Study from Emilia-Romagna, Italy.","<b>Background</b>: The worldwide prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents quadrupled in the past decades, becoming a public health priority. Following the recommendation by the Italian Minister of Health, the Emilia-Romagna Region started a community-based program aimed at reducing pediatric overweight through children and family behavioral counseling on nutrition and physical activity. <b>Methods</b>: Children with excess weight, aged 2-17 years, and without severe diseases were visited five times by a multidisciplinary team, who provided dietary advice, exercise plans, and psychosocial support, according to Italian guidelines. The outcomes were the median pre-post change in Δ<sub>30</sub>BMI (distance between children's BMI and age- and sex-specific obesity threshold values) and the proportion of children who moved to a lower weight class. Logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of weight improvement. <b>Results</b>: Up to March 2025, 1331 participants completed the follow-up. In total, 17.5% of the children showed an improvement in weight class, and 32.5% had a reduction of more than one unit of Δ<sub>30</sub>BMI. The program was significantly and substantially more effective among the children with obesity at baseline (overweight vs. obese children adjusted odds ratio-aOR-of weight class improvement: 0.28; <i>p</i> < 0.001), older than eight years (9-11 years vs. 2-8 years children aOR: 1.41; <i>p</i> < 0.05), who adhered to breakfast recommendations (aOR: 1.60; <i>p</i> < 0.01) and had no obese parents (≥1 vs. 0 obese parents aOR: 0.62; <i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: The multidisciplinary model was associated with an overall positive impact on the weight status of the enrolled children. Given the varying response, however, in order to maximize cost-effectiveness, future programs could be reserved for children with obesity, older than eight years.

"CAMKK1 in Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Evidence of Interaction With Appetite-Regulating, Metabolic and Inflammatory Factors.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 1 (CAMKK1) regulates energy homeostasis through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). CAMKK1 has been implicated in appetite and satiety regulation; however, its role in obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unexplored. In this cross-sectional study, the primary aim was to confirm whether CAMKK1 is elevated in individuals with diabetes. The secondary aim was to investigate CAMKK1's molecular correlates.<h4>Methods</h4>CAMKK1 serum levels in individuals with obesity (n = 3,061), patients with T2DM (n = 4,910) and controls (n = 44,257) were retrieved and compared (age, body mass index-BMI and sex-adjusted ANCOVA). Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression coefficients (age and BMI-adjusted) were computed. The moderation effect of diagnostic groups was also assessed. The interaction between factors was explored by mixed graphical models.<h4>Results</h4>CAMKK1 was elevated in patients with T2DM, in comparison to both individuals with obesity and controls (post hoc comparison, Tukey-adjusted p = 0.010 and p = 0.044, respectively). Across diagnostic groups, positive associations were observed between CAMKK1 and AMPK (min β > 0.400, max p < 0.001) or TNFα (min > β 0.070, max p < 0.001). A positive association with leptin (β = 0.010, p = 0.002) and ghrelin (β = 0.005, p = 0.048) was observed only within controls. Multivariate multivariable models confirmed that specific interactions between factors were disrupted in patients with T2DM (p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings provide new insights into the role of CAMKK1 in obesity and T2DM.

Exploring Sarcopenic Obesity in the Cancer Setting: Insights from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on Prognosis and Predictors Using Machine Learning.,"<b>Objective</b>: Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a combination of depleted skeletal muscle mass and obesity, with a high prevalence, undetected onset, challenging diagnosis, and poor prognosis. However, studies on SO in cancer settings are limited. We aimed to explore the association between SO and mortality and to investigate potential predictors involved in the development of SO, with a further objective of constructing a model to detect its occurrence in cancer patients. <b>Methods</b>: The data of 1432 cancer patients from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the years 1999 to 2006 and 2011 to 2016 were included. For survival analysis, univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the associations of SO with overall survival, adjusting for potential confounders. For machine learning, six algorithms, including logistic regression, stepwise logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were utilized to build models to predict the presence of SO. The predictive performances of each model were evaluated. <b>Results</b>: From six machine learning algorithms, cancer patients with SO were significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.368, 95%CI 1.107-1.690) compared with individuals without SO. Among the six machine learning algorithms, the optimal LASSO model achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.891 on the training set and 0.873 on the test set, outperforming the other five machine learning algorithms. <b>Conclusions</b>: SO is a significant risk factor for the prognosis of cancer patients. Our constructed LASSO model to predict the presence of SO is an effective tool for clinical practice. This study is the first to utilize machine learning to explore the predictors of SO among cancer populations, providing valuable insights for future research.",2025,[],[]
Association of Triglyceride-Glucose Body Mass Index with Target Organ Damage in Essential Hypertension: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"The triglyceride-glucose body mass index (TyG-BMI) is an emerging composite metabolic indicator in cardiovascular research. However, the link between TyG-BMI and target organ damage (TOD) in essential hypertension (EH) remains uncertain. This study investigated the association between TyG-BMI and TOD in patients with EH. We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 493 individuals with EH. Participants were divided at the cohort-specific median into high and low TyG-BMI groups. Over a median follow-up of 23 months, 191 participants experienced TOD. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of TOD in the high TyG-BMI group than in the low TyG-BMI group (p < 0.05). In multivariable logistic regression, TyG-BMI remained an independent correlate of TOD (adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.08-3.10; p < 0.05). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression further selected TyG-BMI, age, and smoking status as key predictors of TOD. Subgroup analyses revealed that the TyG-BMI-TOD association was stronger among younger or middle-aged, normal-weight, non-diabetic, non-smoking subjects (p < 0.05). Finally, the TyG-BMI-based model achieved predictive accuracy comparable to that of a conventional risk-factor model. In conclusion, TyG-BMI is independently associated with TOD in EH patients. Its predictive value closely mirrors that of combined traditional risk factors, highlighting TyG-BMI as a promising clinical marker.",2025,"['##g -', 't', '##yg - b', 't', '##yg - b', 't', '##yg - b', 'tyg - b', 'tyg - b', 't', '##yg - b', 't', '##yg - b', 't', '##yg - bmi', 't', '##yg - b', 't', '##yg - b', 'tyg - b']",[]
[Local overexpression of miR-429 sponge in subcutaneous white adipose tissue improves obesity and related metabolic disorders].,"Obesity is a worldwide health problem. An imbalance in energy metabolism is an important cause of obesity and related metabolic diseases. Our previous studies showed that inhibition of miR-429 increased the protein level of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in beige adipocytes; however, whether local inhibition of miR-429 in subcutaneous adipose tissue affects diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of local overexpression of miR-429 sponge in subcutaneous adipose tissue on obesity and related metabolic disorders. The control adeno-associated virus (AAV) or AAV expressing the miR-429 sponge was injected into mouse inguinal white adipose tissue. Seven days later, the mice were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks to induce obesity. The effects of the miR-429 sponge on body weight, adipose tissue weight, plasma glucose and lipid levels, and hepatic lipid content were explored. The results showed that the overexpression of miR-429 sponge in subcutaneous white adipose tissue reduced body weight and fat mass, decreased fasting blood glucose and plasma cholesterol levels, improved glucose tolerance, and alleviated hepatic lipid deposition in mice. Mechanistic investigation showed that the inhibition of miR-429 significantly upregulated the expression of UCP1 in adipocytes and adipose tissue. These results suggest that local inhibition of miR-429 in subcutaneous white adipose tissue ameliorates obesity and related metabolic disorders potentially by upregulating UCP1, and miR-429 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.",2025,"['mir - 429', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'mir - 429', 'mir - 429 sponge', 'mir - 429 sponge', 'mir - 429 sponge', 'mir - 429 sponge', 'mir - 429', 'ucp1', 'mir - 429', 'ucp1', 'mir - 429']","['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
Targeted in vivo gene integration of a secretion-enabled GLP-1 receptor agonist reverses diet-induced non-genetic obesity and pre-diabetes.,"<h4>Background</h4>In vivo genome editing offers a long-term therapeutic approach for monogenic diseases by directly modifying genetic sequences. However, its application to non-monogenic, noncommunicable diseases, which are the leading causes of global mortality, remains limited due to the lack of well-defined genetic targets.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an in vivo genome-editing approach to introduce a gene encoding the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist Exendin-4, modified with a secretion signal peptide. Mice with obesity and pre-diabetic conditions received a single administration of genome editing. Blood Exendin-4 levels, food intake, body weight, and metabolic parameters were monitored over several months.<h4>Results</h4>Here we show that in vivo genome editing enables sustained Exendin-4 secretion from liver cells, leading to prolonged elevation of Exendin-4 levels in the bloodstream. Treated mice exhibited reduced food intake, attenuated weight gain, and improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity without detectable adverse effects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates that a single administration of genome editing can achieve sustained therapeutic peptide secretion, providing a potential strategy for treating complex diseases without defined genetic causes.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'exendin - 4', 'exendin - 4', 'exendin - 4', 'exendin - 4', 'insulin']","['exendin 4', 'insulin']"
Contemporary and Emerging Therapeutics in Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) Syndrome: In Memory of Professor Akira Endo.,"Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome is a multifaceted, systemic disorder characterized by the interplay of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and obesity. This review synthesizes current and emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing the shared pathophysiologic mechanisms driving CKM progression, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal activation. Established pharmacotherapies that include sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like finerenone have demonstrated robust efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events, slowing renal decline, and improving metabolic outcomes. Additionally, novel agents targeting lipoprotein(a), interleukin-6, and hepatic fat accumulation are expanding the therapeutic landscape. RNA-based therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are designed to modulate lipoprotein(a) and PCSK9 expression. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also emerging as a transformative tool for personalized CKM management, enhancing risk prediction and clinical decision-making. The review highlights the relevance of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as a CKM modifier and discusses the approval of resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, for noncirrhotic MASH. By integrating evidence from clinical trials, mechanistic studies, and emerging technologies, this review provides a comprehensive resource for clinicians and researchers navigating the evolving field of CKM syndrome.",2025,"['insulin', 'sodium - glucose cotransporter 2', 'sglt2', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'mineralocorticoid receptor', 'lipoprotein ( a )', 'interleukin - 6', 'lipoprotein ( a )', 'pcsk9', 'thyroid hormone receptor β']","['insulin', 'sglt2', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'mineralocorticoid receptor', 'interleukin 6', 'pcsk9', 'thyroid hormone receptor beta']"

Hypocretin: a promising target for the regulation of homeostasis.,"Hypocretin, also known as orexin, is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that regulates essential physiological processes including arousal, energy metabolism, feeding behavior, and emotional states. Through widespread projections and two G-protein-coupled receptors-HCRT-1R and HCRT-2R-the hypocretin system exerts diverse modulatory effects across the central nervous system. The role of hypocretin in maintaining wakefulness is well established, particularly in narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), where loss of hypocretin neurons leads to excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. However, the mechanisms by which hypocretin stabilizes transitions between sleep stages remain incompletely understood. Additionally, while hypocretin integrates metabolic signals such as glucose, leptin, and ghrelin to promote feeding and energy expenditure, NT1 patients paradoxically experience weight gain despite reduced caloric intake-highlighting unresolved questions about hypocretin's role in energy homeostasis. In the affective domain, preclinical studies suggest hypocretin enhances stress resilience and modulates anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Yet, human data remain inconsistent, in part due to methodological variability and the limited availability of cerebrospinal fluid sampling to accurately assess central hypocretin function. Therapeutically, the hypocretin system is a promising target across several domains. Dual hypocretin receptor antagonists (DORAs), such as suvorexant and daridorexant, are clinically approved for insomnia. Selective HCRT-2R agonists-including TAK-861 and ALKS-2680-are in clinical trials for NT1 and show encouraging results. Additionally, HCRT-2R antagonists like seltorexant are being explored for major depressive disorder. This review will highlight the anatomical distribution, receptor mechanisms, and physiological functions of the hypocretin system. It will also focus to discuss its role in narcolepsy, metabolic regulation, and mood disorders, while addressing key challenges and open questions that must be resolved to fully harness hypocretin's therapeutic potential.",2025,"['hypocretin', 'orexin', 'g - protein - coupled receptors', 'hcrt - 1r', 'hcrt - 2r', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'leptin', 'ghrelin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin receptor', 'hcrt - 2r', 'hcrt - 2r', 'hypocretin', 'hypocretin']","['hypocretin', 'orexin', 'g protein coupled receptors', 'leptin', 'ghrelin', 'hypocretin receptor']"
Serpina3c Mitigates Adipose Tissue Inflammation by Inhibiting the HIF1α-Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Overoxidation in Adipocytes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) inflammation is a critical pathology of obesity-caused heart damage and is closely associated with adipocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction. Serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3C (Serpina3c) has been identified as an adipokine with anti-vWAT inflammatory effects. However, it remains unclear whether Serpina3c deficiency promotion of vWAT inflammation involves adipocyte ER dysfunction and whether it further contributes to heart damage in obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Wild type and Serpina3c knockout (Serpina3c-/-) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) was injected locally into epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of Serpina3c-/- mice to induce eWAT-adipocyte- specific overexpression of Serpina3c (AAV-Serpina3c) or knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (AAV-shHIF1α). In vitro experiments were performed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.<h4>Results</h4>Serpina3c-/- mice exhibited more severe eWAT, serum and heart inflammation after HFD feeding. Consistently, these adverse phenotypes were mitigated in AAV-Serpina3c and AAV-shHIF1α mice. Mechanistically, ER oxidoreductase 1α (Ero1α) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members PDIA3 and PDIA4 were found to be target genes of HIF1α. In the obese mice, Serpina3c deficiency caused adipocyte more hypertrophy, and activated HIF1α-Ero1α/PDI mediated ER overoxidation and ER stress in eWAT. Subsequently, this led to increased adipocyte apoptosis and chemokine production and decreased adiponectin expression, which promoted macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization in eWAT, thus exacerbating eWAT inflammation and ultimately facilitating serum and distal heart inflammation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings indicate that Serpina3c is a significant regulator of adipocyte ER redox homeostasis, thus highlighting Serpina3c as a potential therapeutic target for obesity-related eWAT inflammation and heart damage.",2025,"['serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitor', 'clade a, member 3c', 'serpina3c', 'v', 'serpina3c', 'serpina3c', 'serpina3c', '/', 'serpina3c', '/', 'e', 'serpina3c', 'aav - serpina3c', 'hypoxia - inducible factor 1α', 'aav - shhif1α', 'serpina3', '##av -', 'serpina3c', '##if1α', 'er oxidoreductase 1α', 'ero1α', 'protein disulfide isomerase', 'pdi', 'pdia3', 'pdia4', 'hif1α', 'serpina3c', 'hif1α', 'ero1α', 'pdi', 'adiponectin', 'm', 'serpina3c', 'serpina3c']","['serpina3', 'ero1alpha', 'protein disulfide isomerase', 'pdi', 'pdia3', 'pdia4', 'hif1α', 'adiponectin']"
Copper and hepatic lipid dysregulation: Mechanisms and implications.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and Wilson's disease (WD) are common clinical conditions characterized by hepatic steatosis. Copper has been associated with the progression of hepatic steatosis, but its precise mechanism remains unclear. Emerging research on hepatic copper homeostasis-including its role in liver aging, cuproptosis induction, and lipid metabolism dysregulation-highlighted its significance in liver pathophysiology. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in copper-induced hepatic lipid metabolism abnormalities, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, impaired glucose metabolism, AMPK activation, hepatic nuclear receptor modulation, and cuproptosis. Both copper excess and deficiency could trigger hepatic steatosis <i>via</i> these pathways. This review systematically summarized intracellular copper metabolism regulation, elucidated potential mechanisms of copper-induced hepatic lipid dysregulation, and analyzed copper-lipid metabolism interactions in MASLD and WD. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which copper contributes to hepatic steatosis and offer a theoretical basis for targeting copper homeostasis as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of liver diseases.",2025,['ampk'],['ampk']
Effects of low-intensity endurance exercise and low-dose lithium chloride administration on muscle atrophy in high-fat diet induced obese rats.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>We provided basic scientific data to help prevent and treat sarcopenia in young obese individuals by observing the effects of low-intensity endurance exercise and low-dose lithium treatment on skeletal muscle atrophy in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Six-week-old male Wistar rats were fed an HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity. Next, rats were randomly assigned to four groups and treated with lithium or exercise for 8 weeks. Lithium (10 mg/kg lithium chloride [LiCl], gavage) or endurance exercise (17 m/min, 30 min/day) was performed once daily for 5 days per week. After the experiment, body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and tissues were extracted after anesthesia and analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Endurance exercise or 8 weeks of lithium had no significant effect on the morphology of the liver and kidney tissues in rats. Although lithium and endurance exercises alone increased the lean body mass, the difference was not statistically significant. However, combined treatment with lithium and endurance exercise significantly increased the lean body mass. No significant difference was noted in the abdominal fat mass between the groups. Eight weeks of lithium or endurance exercise did not affect the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression in the skeletal muscles of obese rats. However, it significantly inhibited the FOXO1 signaling pathway, a muscle atrophy signal, and reduced the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A combination of low-intensity endurance exercise and low-dose lithium prevented muscle atrophy (wasting) by inhibiting the FOXO1 signaling pathway in skeletal muscles. Therefore, light walking and lithium supplementation in daily life are expected to prevent muscle atrophy in obese patients. However, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions based on the results of this study alone and additional research is warranted.",2025,"['of rap', 'mtor', 'foxo1', 'tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) α', 'foxo1']","['mtor', 'foxo1']"
CNIH4 regulates metabolic adaptations to exercise through β-adrenergic receptor-mediated ECM remodeling,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Exercise generates various metabolic benefits by inducing extensive metabolic remodeling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which is primarily mediated by β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) signaling.

Thermal challenge and food intake: Mutual regulatory mechanisms.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Human energy homeostasis principally depends on thermal and food intake regulation mechanisms. In addition to describing the major pathways, brain centers, and their connections which control these functions, this review focuses on (i) interrelations between thermoregulation and food intake, (ii) the role of tanycytes, and (iii) the regenerative capacity of the system in mammals. In the arcuate nucleus, anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin/melanocyte-stimulating hormone neurons and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide neurons are reached by a wealth of dietinduced (e.g., leptin, ghrelin, or insulin) or hormonal (e.g., thyroid hormone) signals. These neurons are not only sensitive to temperature signals but also point to both direct and indirect executors of thermoregulation through axonal projection onto the sympathetic system, by producing cleaved proopiomelanocortin products and by reaching endocrine orchestrators, including corticotropinreleasing hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Meanwhile, ambient temperature affects food intake: the warm-cold separated spinobrachialpreoptic area pathways ultimately target agouti-related peptide neurons to attenuate or increase cold-evoked feeding. The brainstem, hypothalamic, and preoptic area centers of these pathways are reached by a wide array of modulatory signals, which refine thermal and dietetic regulation according to conditions such as daily cycle, stress, or fever. We also review regulating mechanisms that are activated in an extreme form of fasting when food becomes unavailable: a specific body temperature control in hibernating animals during the winter months. Understanding this mechanism could likely contribute to medical applications; i.e., artificial induction of a hibernation-like hypometabolic state. Tanycytes uniquely shape energy homeostasis: they dynamically shape the blood-brain barrier to regulate neurohormone sequestration into the brain parenchyme, but also shuttle between the blood circulation and the cerebrospinal fluid bidirectionally. Therefore, blood- or liquor-borne signals not only target arcuate hypothalamic neurons from different circulatory systems, but the activity of diverse groups of neurohormone (such as leptin or ghrelin)-sensitive periventricular neurons will be synchronized. Tanycytes can likely link thermal and food-intake regulations: they carry receptors (most importantly transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1, glucose, and cytokine receptors) which enable them to sensitively monitor and react to both thermal and energy homeostatic challenges, including anorexia, while they reduce feeding in heat exposure via a specific parabrachial-tanycyte-hypothalamic circuitry. Tanycytes also emerge as the source for the regenerative potential of thermal and energy homeostasis: they not only display functional and morphological plasticity but also neural stem cell properties; they supply the arcuate nucleus with new neurons in both temperature- and diet-responsive manners, which are compromised in extreme/pathological heat challenges or diet-induced obesity, respectively.",2025,"['proopiomelanocortin', 'melanocyte - stimulating hormone', 'orexi', 'neuropeptide y', 'agouti - related peptide neurons', 'leptin', 'ghrelin', 'insulin', 'proopiomelanocortin products', 'corticotropinreleasing hormone', 'thyrotropin - releasing hormone', 'agouti - related peptide', 'leptin', 'ghrelin', 'transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1', 'cytokine receptors']","['proopiomelanocortin', 'melanocyte stimulating hormone', 'neuropeptide y', 'leptin', 'ghrelin', 'insulin', 'corticotropinreleasing hormone', 'thyrotropin releasing hormone', 'transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1', 'cytokine receptor']"
The Acute Effects of Morning Bright Light on the Human White Adipose Tissue Transcriptome: Exploratory Post Hoc Analysis.,"The circadian rhythm of the central brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is synchronized by light. White adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the metabolic endocrine organs containing a molecular clock, and it is synchronized by the SCN. Excess WAT is a risk factor for health issues including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). We hypothesized that bright-light exposure would affect the human WAT transcriptome. Therefore, we analyzed WAT biopsies from two previously performed randomized cross-over trials (trial 1: <i>n</i> = 8 lean, healthy men, and trial 2: <i>n</i> = 8 men with obesity and DM2). From 7:30 h onwards, all the participants were exposed to either bright or dim light. Five hours later, we performed a subcutaneous abdominal WAT biopsy. RNA-sequencing results showed major group differences between men with obesity and DM2 and lean, healthy men as well as a differential effect of bright-light exposure. For example, gene sets encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation or respiratory chain complexes were down-regulated under bright-light conditions in lean, healthy men but up-regulated in men with obesity and DM2. In addition to evident group differences between men with obesity and DM2 and healthy lean subjects, autonomic or neuroendocrine signals resulting from bright-light exposure also differentially affect the WAT transcriptome.",2025,[],[]
The Functional Interaction Between PRDM16 and the SREBP Pathway Controls Lipid Metabolism,"Dysregulated lipid metabolism is associated with cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the current report we explore the functional interactions between two im-portant regulators of lipid metabolism, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2 (SREBP1/2) and PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing 16 (PRDM16). The SREBP family of transcription factors regulate cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, primarily in liver but also in white adipose tissue. PRDM16 is a major regulator of brown adipose tissue (BAT) biogenesis and function, and an inhibitor of white adipogenesis. We find that PRDM16 interacts with the nuclear forms of SREBP1/2 and inhibits their transcriptional activities. Consequently, inactivation of PRDM16 enhances the expression of well-established SREBP target genes involved in fatty acid and cho-lesterol synthesis/metabolism. Importantly, PRDM16 inactivation increases the expression of LDL receptor mRNA and protein and augments the cellular uptake of LDL particles. Supporting these findings, PRDM16-deficient cells accumulate more neutral lipids in a SREBP1/2-dependent manner. Inactivation of PRDM16 in white and brown preadipocyte cell lines and human adipose-derived stem cells enhances the expression of SREBP target genes. In addition, the expression of adipogenic markers was increased in mature white adipocytes generated from PRDM16-knockdown preadipocytes. Thus, our study identifies PRDM16 as a novel inhibitor of SREBP-dependent lipid metabolism with implications for adipose biology and metabolic disease.",2025,"['s', '##terol regulatory element - binding protein 1 and 2', 'srebp1 / 2', 'prdi - bf1', 'riz homology domain containing 16', 'prdm16', 'srebp family of transcription factors', 'prdm16', 'prdm16', 'srebp1 / 2', 'prdm16', 'srebp target genes', 'prdm16', 'ldl receptor mrna', 'ldl particles', 'prdm16', 'srebp1 / 2', 'prdm16', 'srebp target genes', 'prdm16', 'prdm16', 'srebp']","['prdm16', 'ldl particle']"
Bromelain Improves Hypothalamic Control of Energy Homeostasis in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Rats.,"Obesity remains a major global health challenge with limited therapeutic options. Bromelain, a proteolytic enzyme complex derived from pineapple, has been recognized for its natural anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous, and appetite-suppressing properties. This study aimed to investigate the effects of bromelain on hypothalamic neuropeptides and metabolic markers in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in rats. Thirty-six male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups: standard diet (SD), standard diet with bromelain (SDBro), high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet with bromelain (HFDBro). Obesity was induced by a 3-month HFD regimen, followed by bromelain supplementation (200 mg/kg/day, orally) for one month. Hypothalamic tissues were analyzed via ELISA for neuropeptide Y (NPY), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). While NPY levels showed no significant changes, POMC increased in the HFD and was normalized with bromelain. GLUT2 was downregulated in the HFD and significantly restored by bromelain. FGF2 levels remained unchanged. IGF1R was upregulated in the HFD but reduced by bromelain, with an unexpected increase in SDBro. Overall, bromelain partially reversed HFD-induced disruptions in hypothalamic energy-regulating pathways, particularly affecting GLUT2 and POMC. These findings highlight bromelain's potential role in central metabolic regulation under dietary stress.",2025,"['neuropeptide y', 'npy', 'pro - opiomelanocortin', 'pomc', 'glucose transporter 2', 'glut2', 'fibroblast growth factor 2', 'fgf2', 'insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor', 'igf1r', 'npy', 'pomc', 'glut2', 'fgf2', 'igf1r', 'glut2', 'pomc']","['neuropeptide y', 'npy', 'pro opiomelanocortin', 'pomc', 'glut2', 'fibroblast growth factor 2', 'fgf2', 'insulin like growth factor 1 receptor', 'igf1r']"
Maternal obesity impairs fetal brown adipogenesis by attenuating fetal FGF21 signaling.,"In mammals, maternal obesity typically impairs brown adipose tissue (BAT) formation in fetuses, increasing their risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not well understood. Our single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed dynamic changes in cell heterogeneity within the fetal interscapular BAT (iBAT) from obese dams, leading to compromised thermogenesis in their offspring. Obese dams displayed elevated levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), while their fetuses exhibited lower circulating FGF21 due to reduced trans-placental transfer. Maternal FGF21, significantly increased during late gestation, was the primary source of fetal FGF21, played a crucial role in regulating fetal brown adipogenesis, and likely prevented metabolic dysfunction in offspring. Additionally, the impaired iBAT development in utero due to maternal obesity could be mitigated by postnatal FGF21 supplementation. This study suggests that FGF21 signaling is a promising target for addressing impaired BAT development in fetuses resulting from maternal obesity.",2025,"['fibroblast growth factor 21', 'fgf21', 'fgf21', 'maternal fgf21', 'fetal fgf21', 'fgf21', 'fgf21']","['fibroblast growth factor 21', 'fgf21']"
Affordable access to GLP-1 obesity medications: strategies to guide market action and policy solutions in the US.,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and glucagon-like peptide 1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor agonists offer weight reduction and associated health benefits that, if sustained over time, have the potential to markedly improve population health. However, over 40% of US adults have obesity, translating into more than 100 million potential new users of obesity medications. Standing in the way of the major opportunity to improve health for these individuals is the massive and likely ongoing cost of treating such a large segment of the population, even though use of the treatments is estimated to be cost-effective over a lifetime. This paper analyzes the range of emerging market approaches and policy reforms that have the potential to help the broader US health system achieve affordable and equitable access to these medications, and the relative advantages, barriers and possible unintended consequences of each approach. We seek to present policymakers and industry leaders with insights and lessons learned from experts while offering a menu of options for the future that will help all stakeholders play an active part in an innovative future of pricing, coverage and payment for new obesity medications.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor', 'glucagon - like peptide 1', 'gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor']"
Effect of Marked Weight Loss on Adipose Tissue Biology in People With Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Weight loss improves insulin sensitivity in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear. We hypothesized that alterations in adipose tissue biology and adipose tissue-related factors in plasma are involved in mediating the systemic metabolic benefits of weight loss.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>We evaluated blood and adipose tissue samples obtained from 10 adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes before and after marked (16-20%) weight loss and >50% increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity, assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.<h4>Results</h4>Weight loss 1) decreased adipose tissue expression of genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling; 2) decreased adipose tissue expression of SERPINE 1, which encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1); 3) did not decrease adipose tissue immune cell content or expression of genes involved in inflammation; 4) decreased adipose tissue ceramide content; 5) decreased plasma PAI-1 and leptin concentrations and increased plasma high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin; and 6) decreased plasma small extracellular vesicle (sEV) concentration and the sEV content of microRNAs proposed to inhibit insulin action, and completely reversed the inhibitory effect of plasma sEVs on insulin signaling in myotubes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest that weight loss increases insulin sensitivity in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes by modifying adipose tissue biology, with concomitant alterations in circulating PAI-1, leptin, HMW adiponectin, and sEV microRNAs.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'serpine 1', 'plasminogen activator inhibitor 1', 'pai - 1', 'pai - 1', 'leptin', 'plasma high - molecular', 'adiponectin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'pai - 1', 'leptin', 'hmw adiponectin']","['insulin', 'plasminogen activator inhibitor 1', 'leptin', 'adiponectin']"

At baseline, late responders compared to early responders were more likely to be male (45% vs. 30%) and had higher body weight (110.2 vs. 103.6 kg), body mass index (BMI) (39.1 vs. 37.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and waist circumference (117.5 vs. 113.4 cm). At the end of dose titration, Week 24, 194 (70%) late responders achieved ≥5% body weight reduction. At Week 72, 250 (90%) late responders achieved ≥5% body weight reduction. The mean time to reach 5% weight reduction for late responders was 24.8 ± 12.7 weeks. Higher doses of tirzepatide were associated with higher proportions of participants achieving various weight reduction thresholds at Weeks 24 and 72.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among late responders to tirzepatide, the vast majority (90%) achieved 5% or more weight reduction at Week 72. This finding suggests that extending treatment well beyond 12 weeks may allow additional patients to achieve clinically meaningful weight reduction.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04184622, available at http://www.<h4>Clinicaltrials</h4>gov/.",2025,[],[]
An Epigenomic Meta-Analysis of Differentially Methylated Sites in Pre- and Post-Metabolic/Bariatric Surgery Adult Female Patients.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Metabolic/bariatric surgery is currently the most successful treatment for patients with obesity; however, a fifth of patients undergoing surgery may not lose enough weight to be considered successful. Recent studies have shown that bariatric/metabolic surgery alters the epigenome and may explain postoperative improvements in metabolic health. The primary objective is to consolidate published differentially methylated CpG sites in pre- and post-metabolic/bariatric surgery female patients and associate them with the respective genes and pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>This systematic review adhered to the PRISMA-P guidelines and was registered with the PROSPERO (CRD42023421852). Following an initial screening of 541 studies using COVIDENCE, six studies were selected, comprising three epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and three candidate gene methylation studies. The published studies collected DNA samples from female patients with obesity before and after surgery (3 months, 6 months, 9-31 months, and 2 years). KEGG pathway analysis was performed on genes where the extracted CpG sites were located.<h4>Results</h4>The meta-analysis showed that 11,456 CpG sites are differentially methylated after a successful weight loss surgery, with 109 sites mapped to genes involved in key metabolic pathways, including FoxO, mTOR, insulin, cAMP, adipocytokine, Toll-like receptor, and PI3K-Akt.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The highlighted differentially methylated CpG sites can be further used to predict the molecular signature associated with successful metabolic/bariatric surgery.",2025,"['cpg sites', 'c', '##g sites', 'cpg sites', 'foxo', 'mtor', 'insulin', 'adipocytokine', 'toll - like receptor', 'pi3k', 'a', '##kt', 'cpg sites']","['foxo', 'mtor', 'insulin', 'adipocytokine', 'toll like receptor', 'pi3k']"
Deep Phenotyping of Obesity: Electronic Health Record-Based Temporal Modeling Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity affects approximately 40% of adults and 15%-20% of children and adolescents in the United States, and poses significant economic and psychosocial burdens. Currently, patient responses to any single antiobesity medication (AOM) vary significantly, making obesity deep phenotyping and associated precision medicine important targets of investigation.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the potential of electronic health records (EHR) as a primary data source for obesity deep phenotyping. We conducted an in-depth analysis of the data elements and quality available from obesity patients prior to pharmacotherapy and applied a multimodal longitudinal deep autoencoder to investigate the feasibility, data requirements, clustering patterns, and challenges associated with EHR-based obesity deep phenotyping.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 53,688 pre-AOM periods from 32,969 patients with obesity or overweight who underwent medium- to long-term AOM treatment. A total of 92 laboratory and vital measurements, along with 79 ICD (International Classification of Diseases)-derived clinical classifications software (CCS) codes recorded within one year prior to AOM treatment, were used to train a gated recurrent unit with decay-based longitudinal autoencoder (GRU-D-AE) to generate dense embeddings for each pre-AOM record. Principal component analysis and Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) were applied to identify clusters.<h4>Results</h4>Our analysis identified at least 9 clusters, with 5 exhibiting distinct and explainable clinical relevance. Certain clusters show characteristics overlapping with phenotypes from traditional phenotyping strategy. Results from multiple training folds demonstrated stable clustering patterns in 2D space and reproducible clinical significance. However, challenges persist regarding the stability of missing data imputation across folds, maintaining consistency in input features, and effectively visualizing complex diseases in low-dimensional spaces.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated longitudinal EHR as a valuable resource for deep phenotyping the pre-AOM period at per patient visit level. Our analysis revealed the presence of clusters with distinct clinical significance, which could have implications in AOM treatment options. Further research using larger, independent cohorts is necessary to validate the reproducibility and clinical relevance of these clusters, uncover more detailed substructures and corresponding AOM treatment responses.",2025,[],[]
ANKK1 Taq1A Gene Variance and Executive Functions in Female Youth with Binge Eating Disorder: A Cross-sectional Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Binge eating disorder (BED) biological and psychological etiology is still not fully understood. This study investigates the relationship between the ANKK1 Taq1A gene variant and BED in female youth with obesity, while also assessing executive functions (EFs).<h4>Methods</h4>The study included eighty young females with obesity, divided into BED and non-BED groups. EFs were assessed using the Stroop test, Digit Span, and the PEBL battery (including Card Sorting, Iowa Gambling, and Go/No-go tests). The ANKK1 Taq1A gene variance was detected via real-time PCR.<h4>Results</h4>No significant differences were found in ANKK1 Taq1A genotypes or allele frequencies between the groups. However, the BED group exhibited worse cognitive flexibility, decision-making, and higher depression levels. Specifically, the BED group scored poorly on tests such as Card Sorting, Iowa Gambling, and Digit Span (<i>p</i> < .001, <i>p</i> = .005, <i>p</i> = 0.07, respectively). A logistic regression analysis indicated that worse cognitive flexibility and high depression severity significantly increased the probability of BED (<i>p</i> = .01, OR = 1.42; <i>p</i> = .001, OR = 1.26, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>No association was found between ANKK1 Taq1A gene variance and BED or EFs performance. The female youth with obesity and BED demonstrated worse cognitive flexibility and decision-making, along with greater depression severity. Worse cognitive flexibility and greater depression severity were found to increase the probability of BED. Thus, evaluating and addressing EF deficits in BED patients, along with managing co-morbid psychiatric conditions, is crucial for improving treatment outcomes.",2025,"['ankk1 taq1a gene variant', 'ankk1 taq1a gene', 'ankk1 taq1a', 'ankk1 taq1a gene']",[]
Global status and trends of proteomics in obesity: a bibliometric analysis and knowledge graph study.,"<h4>Aims</h4>Proteomics plays an essential role in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of obesity. This study aimed to map global research trends, identify major contributors, and examine evolving themes in this field over the past two decades.<h4>Methods</h4>A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) from 1999 to February 2025. Only English-language original articles and reviews were included. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to analyze publication volume, collaboration networks, core journals, citation patterns, and keyword co-occurrence.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1688 publications were analyzed. Research output increased steadily and peaked in 2022. The United States led in publication count and citations, followed by China and Germany. Keyword analysis revealed a clear thematic shift: early studies focused on adipose biology and hormonal regulation, while more recent work highlights topics such as gut microbiota, lipid metabolism, type 2 diabetes, and PCOS. These shifts reflect an increased focus on systemic mechanisms and a stronger link to clinical needs such as diagnosis and personalized treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Proteomics research in obesity has grown in both scale and complexity, with expanding global collaboration and evolving scientific priorities. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the field's development and offers direction for future translational and interdisciplinary efforts.",2025,[],[]
"Use of Semaglutide for Successful Weight Loss and Maintenance in a Non-Obese Population: An Observational, Retrospective Chart Review","<title>Abstract</title>  <p>This retrospective chart review aimed to assess the efficacy of compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient of an FDA-approved weight loss drug for patients with obesity, for weight loss in otherwise healthy, regular, and overweight people (BMI < 29.9). Additionally, a novel method to declare the ideal or target weight, which bridges the difference in body composition, bone structure a sex is proposed. Achieving a target weight is also proposed to measure the success of the elective weight loss (EWL™) program. <bold>Methods:</bold>An internal, retrospective chart review was conducted to assess the efficacy and success of an Elective Weight Loss (EWL™) program. Weight was collected on 326 patients (male n=23, female n=303), with a mean age of 42.2 years, for 12 to 120 weeks. Weekly doses, dose adjustments, when semaglutide was stopped, when the target weight was attained, and weight maintenance were collected. No diet was prescribed. <bold>Results:</bold> The results showed that 96% of the patients lost weight. Five patients gained weight, and seven lost no weight. In non-obese patients (n = 233), the mean start BMI was 25.44 ± 2.6 (20-28), and the end mean BMI was 22.99 ± 2.55, p-value <0.001. Obese patients (n = 93) mean BMI was 34.98 ± 4.6, a mean end BMI of 30.72 ± 4.98, p-value <0.001. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> It was concluded that compounded semaglutide was found to be a safe and highly effective off-label option for elective weight loss in normal and overweight individuals. It promotes weight loss at lower doses and shows potential benefits comparable to moderate calorie restriction in improving cardiometabolic health and supporting anti-aging in non-obese people.</p>",2025,[],[]
Ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for obesity-related metabolic diseases.,"Obesity represents one of the major public health issues threatening the global health and promoting chronic metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance (IR), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and others. Ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death, is a programmed cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. It is characterized by excessive iron accumulation and unregulated lipid peroxidation. The activity of ferroptosis is modulated by multiple factors such as iron, reactive oxygen species, and over 98 unsaturated fatty acids. Mounting evidence indicates that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in obesity-related chronic metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes, IR, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, and MAFLD. Clarifying the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis may discover potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases. This article comprehensively reviews the role, pathogenesis, prevention, treatment strategies, current research gaps and future development directions of ferroptosis in obesity-related chronic metabolic diseases have been thoroughly discussed, and novel perspectives for the future treatment and research of ferroptosis in these diseases carefully provided. It points out directions for basic research on ferroptosis, raises urgent needs for developing precise intervention strategies, and provides new insights into the treatment and study of obesity-related chronic metabolic diseases in the future.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']

Association of Obesity and Innate Immune Markers With Resistance to Biologic Therapy in Psoriasis.,"<h4>Importance</h4>Currently available biologics specifically target dermal adaptive immune molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23, which are crucial in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Despite their remarkably enhanced therapeutic effects compared with those of traditional anti-inflammatory systemic medications, 25% to 50% of patients are still resistant to biologic therapy.<h4>Objective</h4>To delineate the inflammatory microenvironmental factors that affect sustained treatment response in patients with severe psoriasis.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>A cross-sectional study was carried out including patients aged 18 years or older who visited the Gachon University Gil Medical Center dermatology clinic between January 2012 and December 2022 with plaque-type severe psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score greater than 10 and body surface area larger than 10 despite conventional treatment with cyclosporine, methotrexate, acitretin, and phototherapy for longer than 3 months, and treatment with biologics for at least 24 months. Analysis was carried out from December 2023 to September 2024.<h4>Main outcome and measure</h4>Clinical and inflammatory factors associated with sustained response to biologics therapy.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 87 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.2 [12.5] years; 24 female patients and 63 male patients) included in the study, 16 (18.4%) had to switch to other biologics because of an early loss of therapeutic efficacy. Having overweight (body mass index, >25) was the only clinically relevant factor (odds ratio, 17.3; 95% CI, 3.2-434.6; P = .009). Other factors, including initial disease severity before biologics or disease duration until the first use of biologics, were not different between patients with treatment-resistant disease and those with a sustained treatment response. Spatial transcriptomics pathway analyses revealed enriched innate immune signaling and T-helper 17 cells (Th17)/IL-17 signaling pathways, with upregulated expression of innate immune- or neutrophil-related genes, such as TNFSF10, CXCL8, LCN2, S100A8, and S100A9, mainly in the epidermis. Enriched ligand-receptor interactions were observed in the IL-36 family of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling. Immunofluorescence analysis showed enhanced protein expression of lipocalin 2, S100A8/A9, IL-36α, IL-36γ, IL-1RA, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the epidermis.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This cross-sectional study found that dysregulated innate immune responses in the epidermis and heightened neutrophil activity may be responsible for decreased sustainability of therapeutic responses to biologics. Given that current biologics mainly target dermal adaptive immune-related mediators, the development of novel therapeutic strategies to target the epidermal innate immune response, including neutrophils, is warranted.",2025,"['interleukin ( il ) - 17', 'il - 23', 'il - 17', 'tnfs', '# # f10', 'cxcl8', 'lcn2', 's100a8', 's100a9', 'il - 36 family', 'tumor necrosis factor', 'tnf', 'lipocalin 2', 's100a8', 'a9', 'il - 36α', 'il - 36γ', 'il - 1ra', 'tnf - related apoptosis - inducing ligand', 'trail']","['tnf', 'cxcl8', 'lcn2', 's100a8', 's100a9', 'tumor necrosis factor', 'lipocalin 2', 'tnf related apoptosis inducing ligand', 'trail']"
Nutritional Deficiencies Following Bariatric Surgery: A Rapid Systematic Review of Case Reports of Vitamin and Micronutrient Deficiencies Presenting More Than Two Years Post-Surgery.,"Bariatric surgery is the most clinically- and cost-effective intervention for severe obesity. However, without adequate follow-up, it can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Patients require life-long nutritional supplements and follow-up to prevent nutritional deficiencies from developing. This rapid systematic review is the first synthesis of case reports of patients with vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies at least 2 years following bariatric surgery, the point at which patients are typically discharged from specialist bariatric services. Eighty-three cases (74 studies) met inclusion criteria. Female patients accounted for 84% of the reports. Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) was the most common procedure to have been performed, followed by biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). The most frequently reported deficiencies were vitamin A (n = 15), copper (n = 14) and vitamin D (n = 23). In some cases, vitamin replacement led to symptom resolution, but some preceded permanent disability or death. Fifty-one case reports detailed factors contributing to the development of the deficiency. These could be divided into patient factors or health care factors and provide areas to target interventions, including support to adhere to supplementation, appropriate follow-up, and health professional awareness.",2025,[],[]
Impact of Di-(2-Ethylhexyl)-Phthalate on Metabolic Syndrome: Insights from Network Toxicology and Molecular Docking and Dynamics.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is strongly associated with exposure to environmental pollutants, especially endocrine disruptors (EDCs). Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-Phthalate (DEHP), a typical EDC widely found in plastic products, has been shown to interfere with lipid metabolism and insulin signalling. However, the specific molecular mechanism by which it mediates MetS remains unclear.<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to systematically investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the ubiquitous environmental pollutant DEHP on MetS, thereby providing new insights into the role of environmental toxins in metabolic disorders.<h4>Methods</h4>MetS-related disease targets were searched using the GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD databases. DEHP-related targets were obtained from STITCH, SwissTargetPrediction, and ChEMBL. Constructed PPI networks of intersecting targets and visualized and screened core targets in Cytoscape 3.7.1. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the DAVID database to elucidate biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and key pathways (<i>p</i><0.05). In addition, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze the interactions between compounds and targets further.<h4>Results</h4>150 intersecting targets were identified between DEHP and MetS. The PPI network exhibited core targets, including TP53, ESR1, EGFR, TNF, and IL6. GO analysis showed entries in metabolic processes, transcriptional regulation, and redox reactions. The KEGG pathway showed significant enrichment in AGE-RAGE, FoxO, insulin resistance, and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways. DEHP showed strong binding affinity to core targets: TP53 (-5.6 kcal/mol), ESR1 (-6.1 kcal/mol), EGFR (-5.4 kcal/mol), and IL6 (-4.8 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation further verified the results of molecular docking.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study highlights the interaction between environmental pollutants and metabolic dysfunction. These findings highlight the potential role of DEHP in exacerbating MetS and provide a basis for mitigating its health risks through targeted interventions. Further experimental validation is needed in the future to confirm these mechanistic insights.",2025,"['insulin', 'tp53', 'esr1', 'egfr', 'tnf', 'il6', 'insulin', 'tp53', 'esr1', 'egfr', 'il6']","['insulin', 'tp53', 'esr1', 'egfr', 'tnf', 'il6']"
Overall hemostatic potential as a marker of subclinical hypercoagulability in treated psoriasis patients.,"<h4>Background</h4>Psoriasis is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, possibly mediated by inflammation-induced hemostatic dysregulation and hypercoagulability. However, these changes are often difficult to detect with conventional markers.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess hypercoagulability in patients with psoriasis using the Overall Hemostatic Potential (OHP) test, a global integrative test for coagulation and fibrinolysis.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied 80 psoriasis patients (54 men, 26 women, aged 30-45 years) receiving effective topical or systemic treatments (methotrexate, adalimumab, secukinumab or guselkumab) and compared them with 20 healthy controls. We measured OHP, its components - overall coagulation potential (OCP) and overall fibrinolytic potential (OFP) and selected hemostatic markers (platelet count, mean platelet volume, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, P-selectin, D-dimer and fibrinogen).<h4>Results</h4>Psoriasis patients had significantly higher OHP levels, primarily due to decreased OFP, while OCP levels were comparable to the control group - indicating a hypercoagulable state due to impaired fibrinolysis. Other conventional hemostatic markers showed no significant differences. OHP and OFP correlated with residual inflammatory activity, BMI, waist circumference, visceral adiposity and fibrinogen levels, suggesting a relationship between subclinical inflammation, metabolic parameters and hemostatic imbalance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The OHP test reveals a hypercoagulable state in psoriasis patients even in the absence of abnormal standard coagulation markers. OHP could be a practical and sensitive tool to stratify cardiovascular risk in psoriasis, especially in patients with concomitant metabolic disease or persistent inflammation.",2025,"['p - selectin', 'd - dimer', 'fibrinogen', 'fibrinogen']","['p selectin', 'fibrinogen']"
Leptin as a mechanistic link between obesity and systemic lupus erythematous.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystemic, heterogenic and complex autoimmune disease. Similarly, obesity is a chronic condition characterized by excessive adipose tissue and a sustained state of inflammation. Both conditions have shown increasing incidence in recent years, with evidence of closely intertwined pathogenesis. Leptin, a peptide hormone derived from adipokines and produced in white adipose tissue, exhibits functions like those of pro-inflammatory cytokines and plays a key role in regulating the immune system. There is a clear connection linking obesity and SLE. Extensive studies indicate that obese patients have a higher susceptibility to developing immunological diseases, such as SLE, often at younger ages and with an elevated risk of complications. Leptin appears to play a significant role in immune responses and has been implicated as a mediator in the pathogenesis of SLE and obesity. This hormone contributes to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction. Elevated leptin levels have been identified in patients with SLE and have been associated with increased disease risk, higher disease activity, and a greater likelihood of complications. Similarly, increased leptin levels have been observed in individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome. This evidence suggests that leptin may serve as a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for managing SLE, particularly in obese patients.",2025,"['leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin']",['leptin']
Changes in Body Composition in Relation to Metabolic Syndrome: A Compositional Analysis in Adults with Overweight and Obesity.,"<h4>Background/purpose</h4>Current knowledge of the association between body composition and health outcomes is based on traditional regression techniques, where the components of body composition are treated as non-compositional independent variables. Mounting evidence suggests that body tissues are biologically co-dependent and therefore, require a statistical technique that considers this. This study used a compositional data analysis framework to explore the longitudinal association between body composition and a continuous metabolic syndrome score.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants included 288 physically inactive adults (age: 56 ± 12 years [mean ± SD]; 56% female) with overweight or obesity (BMI: 31.3 ± 3.5 kg/m2) who participated in randomized controlled trials that determined the effects of exercise on adipose tissue (visceral, abdominal subcutaneous, peripheral subcutaneous, other adipose tissues) and lean tissues (skeletal muscle, other lean tissues) assessed by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.<h4>Results</h4>Visceral adipose tissue, relative to the mass of the remaining tissues, was significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome score pre- and post-intervention (P < 0.05). The slopes and intercepts of the pre- and post-intervention regression lines between relative visceral adipose tissue mass and metabolic syndrome did not differ (P > 0.2). For a given weight loss, the greater the relative reduction in visceral adipose tissue, the larger the decrease in the predicted metabolic syndrome score.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This novel compositional data analysis reinforces that visceral adipose tissue is an important marker of cardiometabolic risk and should be a primary target for therapeutic strategies in individuals with overweight or obesity.",2025,[],[]
Preexisting Diabetes and Pregnancy: An Endocrine Society and European Society of Endocrinology Joint Clinical Practice Guideline.,"<h4>Background</h4>Preexisting diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for PDM.<h4>Objective</h4>To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations.<h4>Results</h4>In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception.In individuals with T2DM, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.In pregnant individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition.In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (<175 g/day) or usual diet (>175 g/day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175 g/day.In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM.In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting <95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L).In individuals with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to 11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use of hybrid closed-loop pump technology.In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.",2025,"['insulin', 'g', 'hemoglobin', 'hba1c', 'hba1c', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ra', 'glp - 1ra receptor', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'hba1']","['insulin', 'hemoglobin', 'hba1c', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'hba1']"

Liraglutide improves depressive and cognitive deficits in a high-fat diet rat model of obesity: the role of hippocampal autophagy and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.,"<h4>Rationale</h4>Psychiatric disorders are a largely elusive aspect of obesity, representing a growing public health concern. In this regard, a large body of evidence indicates a pivotal role of disturbed autophagic flux in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated neuropsychiatric deficits.<h4>Objectives</h4>This work was designed to evaluate the effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide, which is increasingly utilized for the management of chronic obesity, on the depressive/cognitive deficits in the high-fat diet (HFD) rat model of obesity with an emphasis on its hippocampal mechanistic backgrounds.<h4>Methods</h4>The effects of chronic liraglutide administration (subcutaneous; 300 µg/kg/day for 28 days) were investigated on depressive-like phenotypes, cognitive deficits, and hippocampal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-regulated autophagy.<h4>Results</h4>Chronic liraglutide treatment amended the HFD-induced depressive-like phenotype (in the sucrose preference and the forced swimming tests) and cognitive deficits (in the Morris water maze test). Moreover, liraglutide enhanced the hippocampal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, and p-mTOR and downregulated the expression of the autophagic markers (Beclin-1, LC3) and the inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6) with amelioration of HFD-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work highlights the antidepressant and pro-cognitive properties of liraglutide in HFD-exposed rats, which could be mediated through amelioration of the disrupted PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling activity with a possible impedance of the exaggerated autophagy-mediated neurodegenerative cascades. Indeed, this study highlights that liraglutide is not only effective in weight control, but its effects also extend to managing obesity-related psychiatric disorders.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase', 'pi3k', 'protein kinase b', 'a', '##kt', 'm', 'brain - derived neurotrophic factor', 'bdnf', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'p - akt', 'p - mtor', 'beclin - 1', 'lc3', 'tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'mtor']","['phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase', 'pi3k', 'protein kinase b', 'brain derived neurotrophic factor', 'bdnf', 'akt', 'beclin 1', 'lc3', 'mtor']"
"Impact of Maternal Nutritional Status and Mental Health on Children with Obesity: Relationship Between Anthropometric Parameters, Food Addiction, and Stress.","Childhood obesity is a complex and multifactorial disease influenced by various factors including behavioral, physical, and psychological conditions. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal and child stress and food addiction on the nutritional status of children with obesity. Children aged 6 to 12 years were divided into Control Group (n = 42) and Obesity Group (n = 68) according to BMI-Z score. Mothers were allocated to their children's respective groups. Anthropometric measures, body composition, stress levels, and food addiction were evaluated in both children and mothers. Children with obesity exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of food addiction compared to controls (22.1% vs. 2.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), while mothers in the control group showed higher stress levels (68.6% vs. 46.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.039). Positive correlations were observed between mother-child pairs for weight (r = 0.433, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and waist circumference (r = 0.461, <i>p</i> < 0.01). In children, food addiction was a significant predictor of BMI-Z scores (adjusted R square = 0.186); however, maternal BMI and stress were more important predictors (adjusted R square = 0.468). These findings highlight the influence of maternal physical and psychological health on childhood BMI-Z scores. Effective interventions should target both mother and child to improve overall health outcomes.",2025,[],[]
Clinical and Humanistic Burden of Adult Obesity in Asia-Pacific: A Systematic Literature Review.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity continues to be an increasing global health concern. However, the burden of obesity within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is less well defined relative to Western countries.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature review was conducted to characterise disease burden in people with obesity within the APAC region (defined as body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Australia and Taiwan, ≥ 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in China, and ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong). The presence of obesity-related complications and impact of obesity on patient-reported outcomes is described.<h4>Results</h4>Complications were reported at significantly higher rates in people with obesity compared to people with a normal weight. Diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and cardiovascular diseases were the most frequently reported obesity-related complications, and rates among people with obesity were as high as 57%, 72%, 65%, and 23% respectively. Low scores on patient-reported outcome measures indicated reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people with obesity, with lower HRQoL in those with a higher obesity class. Psychological distress was also elevated in people with obesity which persisted despite treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite variation in the definition of obesity across countries in the APAC region, obesity was consistently associated with notable presence of related metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological complications. Obesity substantially impacts psychosocial and emotional wellbeing and is associated with a reduced HRQoL in people with obesity. This highlights the need to proactively recognise and manage obesity as a chronic relapsing disease to improve the health of people with obesity. Further research is warranted to address identified evidence gaps in the APAC region.",2025,[],[]
Increased levels of syndecan-3 are associated with childhood obesity.,"Childhood obesity is considered an important risk factor for developing obesity in adult. Syndecan-3 (SDC3) has recently come into focus as a possible molecular target involved in alterations of energy homeostasis, however, its role in childhood obesity remains undefined. We measured mRNA expression levels of SDC3 in children and adolescents with obesity from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and correlating them with different anthropometric and biochemical parameters. We performed a cross-sectional study involving 143 Caucasian children and adolescents. We found increased SDC3 expression in children and adolescents with obesity. In addition, a positive statistical correlation has been found between the levels of SDC3 with body weight, BMI, BMI <i>Z</i> score, fat mass, waist circumference, insulin levels, HOMA-IR index, and maximum blood pressure. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the BMI <i>Z</i> score variable was the most significant. Taken together, our results highlight a still unexplored link between SDC3 and childhood obesity.",2025,"['syndecan - 3', 'sdc3', 'sdc3', 'sdc3', 'sdc3', 'insulin', 'homa -', '##r', 'sdc3']","['syndecan 3', 'sdc3', 'insulin']"
Role and Significance of MicroRNAs in the Relationship Between Obesity and Cancer.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that are essential for regulating gene expression at the posttranscriptional stage. Recent research shows that miRNAs are crucial in the development of two major global health issues: obesity and cancer, two significant health issues worldwide. This study examines the complex mechanisms by which miRNAs govern vital biological processes, including adipogenesis, cancer, and metabolic dysregulation. We highlight the dual function of miRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in obesity-related malignancies and investigate their potential as prognostic and diagnostic markers. To demonstrate their varied roles, specific examples of vital miRNAs are underscored, such as miR-21, which promotes adipogenesis and is overexpressed in various cancers, and miR-34a, a tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, we examined the recent developments in miRNA-based therapies, which include miRNA inhibitors, mimics, and novel delivery vehicles and have the potential for treating obesity-related malignancies. This review aims to clarify, within the framework of miRNA biology, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs in addressing the interrelation between obesity and cancer.",2025,"['mir - 21', 'mir - 34a']",[]
Obesity-Associated Adiposomes Promote Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Hypercontractility.,"<h4>Background</h4>Inter-organ crosstalk, particularly between adipose tissue and vasculature, plays a key role in obesity-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. Our previous work showed that adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (adiposomes) from obese donors impair arteriolar vasodilation through endothelial dysfunction, but their impact on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>Visceral adipose tissues were collected from 25 obese and 12 lean subjects undergoing bariatric and elective surgeries, and from high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice (n = 40). Adiposomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and arteriolar myogenic tone was assessed using pressure myography. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured in VSMCs.<h4>Results</h4>Obese arterioles exhibited greater myogenic tone than lean controls, a response also observed in healthy vessels exposed to obese adiposomes. Native VSMCs from obese subjects showed amplified acetylcholine-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, a response also observed in cultured VSMCs exposed to adiposomes from obese humans or DIO mice. Membrane potential analysis showed that obese adiposomes impaired KATP channel function, attenuating pinacidil-induced hyperpolarization while enhancing glibenclamide-mediated depolarization. Obese adiposomes also elevated ROS levels in VSMCs, which were reduced by extracellular ROS scavenging, normalizing K<sub>ATP</sub> channel function and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, thereby ameliorating arterial hypercontractility in obese specimens. Furthermore, depleting ceramides in obese adiposomes diminished their ability to induce hypercontractility, highlighting ceramide as a key mediator of obesity-induced vascular dysfunction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings underscore a pathogenic form of vascular-adipose crosstalk in obesity, where adiposome-mediated signaling alters VSMC excitability and vascular tone. Targeting this inter-organ communication axis may offer new strategies to reverse obesity-related vascular complications.",2025,[],[]

Rising to the challenges of research in multiple long-term conditions: health and social care research ecosystem approaches.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The purpose of this article is to share insights from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) in delivering research for Multiple Long Term Conditions (MLTC) and to highlight lessons of wider relevance across the research ecosystem.<h4>Key reflections</h4>Designing health and care systems to be more responsive to the needs of people living with MLTC requires a considerable evidence base. When compared with research focused on a single disease area, research relating to MLTC raises unique considerations at the stages of planning, placing, and delivering research studies. Our article describes challenges associated with MLTC research outcomes and outlines different types of interventions to target MLTC, along with related research delivery considerations. Our article also raises important considerations for placing research in the most appropriate setting and highlights the vital role of robust feasibility studies, informed by the lived experience of patients and carers with MLTC, for ensuring that studies are conducted, recruited to, and completed in a timely and appropriate way.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Increasing the evidence base for the prevention and management of MLTC is a necessity for our health and care system. This presents novel challenges that require collaboration between multiple stakeholders. The UK benefits from a unique research infrastructure, including support for the stages of planning and delivery of health and care research. As the health and care system moves towards bringing care closer to patients and service users, the appropriate selection of the health and care settings and research sites in which to deliver MLTC research, in addition to understanding and removing barriers to recruitment and participation for people with MLTCs, are important considerations to enable us to collectively respond to this challenge.",2025,[],[]
Therapeutic applications of miRNA in the management of obesity and osteoporosis.,"Obesity and osteoporosis are interrelated global health challenges, both characterized by dysregulated bone metabolism and adipose tissue dynamics, contributing to increased fracture risk and systemic complications. Emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as regulatory molecules governing the intricate balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis, thereby providing a molecular link between these two conditions. Both disorders are characterized by intricate alterations in bone metabolism and adipose tissue dynamics, which increase the risk of fractures and systemic complications. Recent advancements in molecular biology have identified miRNAs as crucial regulators of these disorders, influencing the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and adipocytes (fat-storing cells). This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the dual role of miRNAs in modulating osteogenesis and adipogenesis, with a particular focus on their implications in disease progression and therapeutic strategies. It first explores how specific miRNAs regulate critical energy metabolism, inflammation, and bone remodeling pathways. By integrating insights from molecular biology, endocrinology, and clinical practice, the review highlights the therapeutic potential of miRNA-based interventions. Targeting specific miRNAs could restore the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis, offering innovative approaches to simultaneously address obesity and osteoporosis. These proposed strategies hold promise for improving patient outcomes by mitigating fracture risk, enhancing bone density, and addressing metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity. Ultimately, future research should focus on translating these molecular insights into clinical applications to develop effective therapies that tackle the complex interplay between these prevalent conditions.",2025,[],[]
Overnutrition of Young Bulls Delays In Vitro Embryonic Development and Decreases Embryo Quality.,"Fertility is a significant determinant of productivity in the beef cattle industry and young bulls are often fed highly caloric diets to accelerate growth. However, the effects of such nutritional strategies on early embryonic development remain poorly described. We hypothesized that feeding young bulls a high-gain diet would compromise early embryonic development in vitro. Twenty-nine bulls (13 months of age) were fed a moderate (target average daily gain = 1.22 kg/day; n = 15) or high gain (target average daily gain = 1.81 kg/day; n = 14) diet for 114 days. The high-gain diet increased average daily gain, final body weight, and subcutaneous backfat thickness. Semen was collected and frozen from each bull after 114 d of treatment and used for in vitro fertilization. Semen from high-gain bulls reduced embryo cleavage and early blastocyst formation. Blastocysts from high-gain bulls had fewer blastomeres, altered inner cell mass to trophectoderm ratio, and increased apoptosis. In addition, time-lapse embryo culture indicated that semen from high-gain bulls tended to reduce embryo cleavage and development to morula and early blastocyst stages, and delayed temporal progression to morula and blastocyst hatching. Similarly, semen from high-gain bulls increased cytoplasmic fragmentation of blastomeres during the first three cleavages events. These findings indicate that overnutrition of young bulls produces semen that compromises embryo development and quality, highlighting the need to develop feeding strategies to optimize growth and reproductive potential in cattle.",2025,[],[]
Research Progress on Chemical Components of &lt;i&gt;Astragalus membranaceus&lt;/i&gt; and Treatment of Metabolic Syndrome.,"<i>Astragalus membranaceus</i> (AM), also known as Huangqi in Chinese, refers to the dried root of two Leguminosae species: AM (Fisch.) Bge. and its variety AM (Fisch.) Bge. var. <i>mongholicus</i> (Bge.) Hsiao. In recent years, research on AM has been published in many papers. Its role in treating metabolic syndrome (MetS) has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes the research progress over the past five years on the chemical constituents of AM and its therapeutic potential in MetS-related diseases. Chemical analyses of AM have gradually expanded from its roots to its stems, leaves, and entire plant. The major compounds isolated from AM include flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides. Extraction methods include ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and in vitro intestinal absorption models combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array-tandem mass spectrometry. AM and its active components exert beneficial effects on metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. These effects are achieved mainly through mechanisms such as reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, modulating gut microbiota, regulating lipid metabolism, improving insulin resistance, and protecting pancreatic β-cell function. This review provides a reference for further studies on treatment of MetS of AM.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
An alternative neural basis underlying leptin resistance.,"Overconsumption of a palatable Western diet, a condition linked to central leptin resistance, contributes extensively to the current obesity epidemic. In this context, intensive efforts have focused on detailing the molecular mechanisms underlying leptin resistance. Here, we demonstrate that chronic inhibition of hypothalamic arcuate GABAergic neurons (Arc<sup>GABA</sup>) effectively reduced diet-induced obesity (DIO). Interestingly, palatable food exposure increased the activity level of Arc<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, which do not express the leptin receptor (non-LepR neurons; nonresponsive to leptin). Chronic activation of Arc<sup>GABA</sup> non-LepR neurons led to massive obesity, which was associated with normal leptin-induced pSTAT3 signaling but phenotypic leptin resistance; i.e., high leptin levels failing to reduce obesity. In contrast, chronic inhibition of Arc<sup>GABA</sup> non-LepR neurons effectively prevented and reversed DIO, suggesting a potential anti-obesity treatment strategy. These results reveal that obesogenic stimulation of Arc<sup>GABA</sup> non-LepR neurons, even with intact leptin-pSTAT3 signaling, results in obesity, identifying a novel neural basis underlying leptin resistance.",2025,"['leptin', 'leptin', 'arc', 'arc', 'leptin receptor', 'leptin', 'arc', 'leptin', 'pstat3', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'arc', 'arc', 'leptin', 'pstat3', 'leptin']","['leptin', 'arc', 'leptin receptor']"
Nutritional Influences on Brown and Beige Adipocyte: Unraveling the Molecular Mechanisms and Metabolic Implications.,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipose tissue (beige fat) function as thermogenic organs, significantly influencing human metabolism through various mechanisms. Recent findings suggest that dietary nutrient supplementation targeting BAT offers innovative strategies for enhancing energy homeostasis and addressing metabolic diseases. Identifying the molecular mechanisms through which nutrition regulates the function of brown and beige adipocytes is essential for translating preclinical findings into clinical applications. This review initially delineates the physiological characteristics of BAT and elucidates the regulatory mechanisms underlying its metabolic functions and associated signaling pathways. Subsequently, we examine the impact of macronutrients, micronutrients, and nutritional stimulants on BAT functionality. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential of refined dietary strategies as future approaches for managing metabolic disorders by targeting BAT. In conclusion, nutrient-focused dietary strategies can enhance BAT function and activity, thereby contributing to the modulation of metabolic disorders and the optimization of metabolic health.",2025,[],[]
High-Fat-Diet-Induced Kidney Injury in Rats: The Role of Tart Cherry Supplementation.,"The kidney plays a crucial role in the complex inter-organ communication that occurs during obesity, leading to the development of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Dysfunction of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels contributes to this pathophysiology. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of antioxidant-rich fruit tart cherry (<i>Prunus cerasus</i> L.) on kidney morphology and protein expression in rats with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Methods include histological staining and immunohistochemical and Western blot assays. Obese rodents were fed with seed powder (DS) and seed powder plus juice (DJS) of the tart cherry. Results demonstrated that rats fed a high-fat-diet (HFD) showed a significant reduction in renal expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) following tart cherry supplementation. Furthermore, the study provided evidence that TRP channels, specifically TRP canonical 1 (TRPC1) and TRP melastatin 2 (TRPM2), were significantly upregulated in obese animals (<i>p</i> < 0.05 vs. CHOW rats) and markedly downregulated following tart cherry supplementation (<i>p</i> < 0.05 vs. DIO rats). In conclusion, these TRP proteins offer new insights for identifying targets and biomarkers for developing therapeutic strategies against HFD-induced renal damage, characterized by glomerulosclerosis, fibrosis, and inflammation. Tart cherries supplementation exerted a protective effect on the kidneys by reducing protein oxidation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.",2025,"['transient receptor potential', 'trp', 'interleukin - 1 beta', 'il - 1β', 'interleukin - 6', 'il - 6', 'trp channels', 'trp canonical 1', 'trpc1', 'trp melastatin 2', 'trpm2', 'trp proteins']","['trp', 'interleukin 1 beta', 'interleukin 6', 'trpc1', 'trpm2']"
From pathophysiology to novel approaches for obesity-associated hypertension.,"Obesity is a rapidly growing epidemic affecting >15% of the global adult population and has considerable clinical consequences and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. There is a strong association between obesity or body mass index and high blood pressure (BP) in epidemiological studies while the underlying pathophysiological events linking those conditions are not fully elucidated. Hypothetical mechanisms include a sedentary lifestyle and excess intake of processed foods that contribute to obesity, overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, inflammation, altered adipokine homeostasis and the fatty kidney hypothesis involving adipose tissue accumulation in the renal sinus and perirenal space. There are multiple pharmacotherapeutic and surgical approaches for the management of obesity, including dual and triple agonist drugs targeting glucagon-like peptide-1, gastric inhibitory peptide and glucagon receptors and endoscopic bariatric procedures. Despite promising results with such therapeutic approaches in terms of body weight reduction and BP control, it is unclear whether such BP reduction may completely be attributable to weight loss. Confirmation of the adiposity dependence would lead to a major paradigm shift in our understanding of hypertension, potentially leading to a major shift in the causes of hypertension from primary hypertension to adiposity-dependent hypertension, leading to a shift from symptomatic treatment with antihypertensive medication to cause-focused treatment with weight loss medication. In this narrative review, the aim is to evaluate the potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypertension and obesity and the efficiency of potential therapeutic approaches on BP.",2025,"['renin', 'an', '##giotensin', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'gastric inhibitory peptide', 'glucagon receptors']","['renin', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'glucagon receptor']"
Early Maladaptive Schemas as Core Therapeutic Targets in Eating Disorders and Obesity: A Schema Therapy-Informed Network Analysis.,"Early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) are stable cognitive-emotional patterns central to the psychopathology of eating disorders (EDs) and obesity. This study used a schema therapy-informed network analysis to explore the structure and significance of EMSs in people with anorexia nervosa (AN, n = 129), bulimia nervosa (BN, n = 124), binge-eating disorder (BED, n = 166), and obesity (n = 152). Networks were modelled using the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S3), with expected influence as the main centrality, in a final sample of 571 patients. In AN, the most central schemas were Defectiveness/Shame, Negativity/Pessimism, and Subjugation, reflecting self-criticism, hopelessness, and submission. BN showed a similar pattern with high centrality for Subjugation, Defectiveness/Shame, and Negativity/Pessimism. In BED, central EMSs included Subjugation, Social Isolation, Negativity/Pessimism, and Abandonment, emphasizing loneliness and emotional vulnerability. The obesity group showed dominant roles for Negativity/Pessimism, Social Isolation, Subjugation, and Mistrust/Abuse, indicating patterns of mistrust, hopelessness, and relational avoidance. Negativity/Pessimism and Subjugation were central across all groups, highlighting their transdiagnostic relevance. Interestingly, Social Isolation appeared prominently in BED and obesity, possibly associated with earlier experiences of bullying and rejection. These findings underscore the clinical value of targeting central EMSs in schema therapy, offering a network-based framework to guide individualized interventions across EDs and obesity.",2025,[],[]

Exosomes carrying lncRNA FLG-AS1 overexpression vectors inhibit the tumorigenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma via fat mass and obesity-associated protein-mediated m6A modification.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) selectively incorporated into exosomes contribute to the tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the role of the lncRNA FLG-AS1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has yet to be investigated. Hence, the current study aimed to evaluate the potential role of exosome-derived FLG-AS1 in OSCC. The expression of FLG-AS1 and fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in OSCC samples were determined via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The role of FLG-AS1 in OSCC was investigated by performing CCK8, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. Additionally, bioinformatics, methylated (m6A) RNA immunoprecipitation, and RT-qPCR were performed to evaluate the n6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of FLG-AS1 and its underlying mechanism. Characterization of exosomal FLG-AS1 in OSCC cells was achieved through transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, Western blot analysis of CD63 and CD9, and RT-qPCR. Finally, the effects of exosomal FLG-AS1 on OSCC cell malignancy was analyzed using the aforementioned cell-based assays. Overall, our findings showed that low FLG-AS1 expression in OSCC restricted the malignant properties of OSCC cells. Furthermore, FTO reduced FLG-AS1 expression by mediating its m6A demethylation in OSCC cells. Exosomal FLG-AS1 expression was upregulated in OSCC cells, suggesting that it was packaged in the OSCC cell-derived exosomes, whereas exosome-derived FLG-AS1 overexpression vector reduced the malignant potential of the target OSCC cells. In conclusion, exosomal FLG-AS1 functions as a tumor suppressor in OSCC, while FTO can impair FLG-AS1 expression through m6A demethylation.",2025,"['flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'obesity - associated protein', 'fto', 'flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'ex', 'flg - as1', 'cd63', 'cd9', 'ex', 'flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'fto', 'flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'flg - as1', 'fto', 'flg - as1']","['fto', 'cd63', 'cd9']"
Deferoxamine addresses metabolic dysregulation and urinary tract infections in weight-associated gestational diabetes mellitus.,"<h4>Background</h4>The increasing prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), particularly among overweight or obese individuals, poses significant health risks. Excess iron contributes to oxidative stress, inflammation, and disruptions in immune and metabolic functions in GDM. Deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, may offer a therapeutic solution by restoring immune and metabolic balance.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis using GEO transcriptomic data, applying Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis to identify key immune-metabolic genes. Molecular docking experiments with DFO were performed using AutoDock Vina, and interactions were visualized in PyMOL. Various in vitro assays-CCK-8, qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and colony formation tests-were conducted under high glucose conditions to assess the effects of DFO, focusing on LAMA3 and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.<h4>Results</h4>Key genes such as CDR2L, LIMCH1, LDLR, and LAMA3 were identified as being improperly regulated in cases of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DFO demonstrated a significant affinity for these targets, especially LDLR. Functionally, DFO was found to improve cell survival during hyperglycemic stress, mitigate oxidative stress, and lower the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23. Notably, silencing or blocking LAMA3 reversed these effects, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, increasing apoptosis markers, and decreasing cell proliferation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DFO holds potential as a targeted treatment for GDM associated with obesity by addressing iron excess and immune-metabolic dysregulation. LAMA3 plays a crucial role in mediating DFO's anti-inflammatory and survival-promoting effects via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Further clinical studies are needed to explore DFO's therapeutic potential in GDM.",2025,"['dfo', 'd', 'lama3', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'cdr2l', 'limch1', 'ldlr', 'lama3', 'dfo', 'ldlr', 'd', 'il - 6', 'il - 17', 'il - 23', 'lama3', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'lama3', 'd', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'dfo']","['dfo', 'lama3', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'cdr2l', 'limch1', 'ldlr']"

Investigating the Moderating Effect of Attitudes Toward One's Own Aging on the Association Between Body Mass Index and Executive Function in Older Adults.,"<b>Background:</b> This cross-sectional study examined the association between body mass index (BMI) and executive function (EF) in older adults, with a focus on the moderating role of attitudes toward own aging (ATOA). <b>Method:</b> A total of 431 community-dwelling elderly individuals from Yakumo Town and Kyoto City, Japan, participated between 2023 and 2024. EF was assessed using the Digit Cancellation Test (D-CAT), and ATOA was measured via a validated subscale of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale. <b>Results:</b> Multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for demographic and health covariates revealed a significant interaction between BMI and ATOA in the younger-old cohort. Specifically, higher BMI was associated with lower executive function only in individuals with lower ATOA scores. No such association was observed in those with more positive views on aging. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results indicate that positive psychological constructs, particularly favorable self-perceptions of aging, may serve as protective factors against the detrimental cognitive consequences of increased body mass index in younger-old populations.",2025,[],[]
"Hypertension, Obesity, and Target Organ Injury in Children: An Emerging Health Care Crisis.","<h4>Purpose of review</h4>To review data regarding the association between hypertension and childhood obesity on target organ damage. We will also review data regarding the impact of intervening on hypertension and childhood obesity on target organ damage.<h4>Recent findings</h4>The prevalence of hypertension and obesity are rising in children despite efforts to address these risk factors. Health disparities play a role in contributing to the rise in prevalence. Hypertension and obesity promote pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system which result in adverse effects on blood pressure regulation and renal function. Adverse cardiac, vascular, renal, neurocognitive, and retinal changes can be seen with elevated blood pressure. Recent intervention studies are few, but adequate treatment of hypertension and obesity can result in improvement in target organ damage. Hypertension and obesity have significant impacts upon target organs. Interventions to decrease blood pressure and treat obesity are associated with reductions in left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in measures of systolic and diastolic function, and improvement in renal outcomes. Appropriate screening and management of these conditions can lessen potential future cardiovascular impact.",2025,"['renin', 'an', '##giotensin', 'al']",['renin']

Despite the fact that the HbA1c < 7% target at baseline was 38.92% for metformin, 17.64% for SGLT-2i, and 41.17% for GLP-1 RAs, BWR was achieved less, probably influenced by insulin treatment. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study shows real-world Romanian efficacy and over the time response of administering the new classes in T2DM patients when aiming for HbA1c < 7% levels and 5% BWR, with SGLT-2i outperforming metformin and GLP-1 RAs, emphasizing their growing role in the management of T2DM.",2025,"['glp - 1 ras', 'sglt - 2i', 'hba1c', 'sglt - 2i', 'glp - 1 ras', 'h', '##1', 'sglt - 2i', 'glp - 1 ras', 'sglt - 2i', 'glp - 1 ras', 'hba1c', 'sglt - 2i', 'glp - 1 ras', 'insulin', 'hba1c', 'sglt - 2i', 'glp - 1 ras']","['hba1c', 'insulin']"
Analysis of Tirzepatide Acquisition Costs and Weight Reduction Outcomes in the United Kingdom: Insights from the SURMOUNT-1 Study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Tirzepatide, an anti-obesity medication, demonstrated significant weight loss efficacy in the SURMOUNT-1 randomized controlled trial. This analysis evaluates the cost-efficiency of tirzepatide in the UK by linking clinical outcomes to drug acquisition costs.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from SURMOUNT-1 (2539 participants across global sites) were used to assess tirzepatide's (5, 10, and 15 mg) impact on weight reduction over 72 weeks (72W), with a focus on drug acquisition costs and cost/weight loss outcome. Cost needed to treat and cost-to-target analyses were performed to determine the economic value of achieving specific weight loss goals and improvements in body mass index (BMI).<h4>Results</h4>Tirzepatide demonstrated significant weight loss, with greater reductions at higher doses. Cost/kilogram of weight loss at 72W was £102.86, £85.41, and £89.24 for 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively. Average per-patient costs at 72W for 5% weight loss were £1852, £1971, and £2186 (5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively; average 28-day costs: £102.90, £109.52, and £121.47). Average per-patient costs for 10% weight loss were £2258, £2209, and £2338 (28-day costs: £125.43, £122.69, and £129.88). The 15 mg dose was the most cost-efficient for achieving higher weight loss targets (15% and 20%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In the SURMOUNT-1 study, tirzepatide was cost-efficient in the UK for weight management, demonstrating favourable economic outcomes relative to its efficacy in reducing body weight and improving BMI. It provided additional health benefits, including reduced risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events and improved mental health. Tirzepatide contributed to cost savings and improved efficiency within the healthcare system by decreasing the burden of obesity-related conditions, thus enhancing overall healthcare resource allocation. These findings support its inclusion in clinical practice guidelines and healthcare formularies. Further research is needed to explore real-world adherence, patient-centred outcomes, and the long-term sustainability of weight loss with tirzepatide.",2025,[],[]

Exploring Strategies to Promote Exercise as a Viable Obesity and Chronic Disease Treatment.,"Obesity and its related comorbidities continue to be a primary public health concern, especially in the United States (US). Such comorbidities include the top two causes of death in the US: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity is also associated with several other chronic conditions that affect millions of adults and children, including diabetes, kidney, and liver disease. Weight loss has long been considered the front-line treatment and prevention strategy for these conditions. Lifestyle approaches, including dietary modification and increasing physical activity, are typically recommended for individuals with obesity, although rates of achieving and maintaining clinically meaningful weight loss remain low. Understanding the root causes of minimal weight loss and weight regain has been a prime focus among many researchers over the past several decades. The present review addresses several advantages of prioritizing exercise as an obesity and chronic disease treatment. We discuss current challenges when exercise is the primary treatment strategy, including physiological parameters that may influence the efficacy of exercise in addition to behavioral and environmental factors that play a role in exercise adherence and adoption. We also explore strategies and principles that, although not commonly utilized in an obesity/chronic disease treatment setting, may be applied and adapted to fit this model.",2025,[],[]
Gaining Biological Insights Into Deltamethrin-Induced Toxicity and Resistance at the Molecular Level.,"Deltamethrin (DM), a type II pyrethroid, is one of the most widely used insecticides around the world. The link between diseases including obesity, neurodevelopmental disorders, liver fibrosis and DM treatment has been elucidated in organisms that exposed DM. Also, in aquatic organisms, hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, impaired cellular development, and decreased mobility could be related to DM treatment for pond cleaning and fending off arthropods causing diseases such as Caligidosis. Apart from that, DM resistance in target organisms has been a staggering issue due to the prevalence of DM-resistant insects, which make challenging to overcome vector-borne diseases, agricultural corps' yield, and economic loss in aquaculture. Using omics analysis in organisms exposed to DM, systems biology tools have provided a detailed understanding of the interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites, and microbiota at molecular level. This review underscores the mechanisms of how DM leads to toxicity in model and nontarget organisms, and how target organisms evolve from being susceptible to resistant as a molecular response. Overall, an in-depth analysis of the molecular mechanisms behind DM exposure will provide a comprehensive understanding of the DM application for its risk assessment.",2025,[],[]
Advances in Mendelian Randomization Studies of Obesity Over the Past Decade: Uncovering Key Genetic Mechanisms.,"Obesity is a major global public health issue linked to a wide range of chronic diseases. Understanding its complex causal pathways requires robust analytical methods. Mendelian randomization (MR), which employs genetic variants as instrumental variables, effectively addresses confounding and reverse causation and has become a key tool in obesity research. This review summarizes the development of MR methodologies, from single-sample to multivariable, mediation, and time-series models, and highlights key findings from the past decade. MR studies have revealed causal associations between obesity and nine major disease categories, including cardiovascular, metabolic, cancer, psychiatric, respiratory, renal, reproductive, musculoskeletal, and dermatological disorders. Obesity influences disease risk through mechanisms involving energy metabolism, hormonal regulation, and inflammation, with heterogeneity by age, sex, and fat distribution. Key genes such as <i>MC4R, LEPR, FTO</i>, and <i>FGF21</i> have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. Current challenges include instrument strength, pleiotropy, population stratification, and the external validity of GWAS data. Future research that integrates multi-ancestry GWAS, functional validation, and multi-omics approaches may further enhance the utility of Mendelian randomization. MR provides a robust genetic framework for elucidating obesity's causal effects and informing targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies.",2025,"['mc4r', 'lepr', 'fgf21']","['mc4r', 'lepr', 'fgf21']"

Impact of exercise on anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis based on 113 randomized controlled trials worldwide.,"<h4>Background</h4>At present, the situation of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents around the world is dire. Developing exercise programs for this population is important, based on the vast evidence available, to halt the global rise in childhood and adolescent obesity.<h4>Method</h4>Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and WanFang were searched, the search period was from March 1, 2010, to March 31, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of exercise on anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity were retrieved.<h4>Result</h4>A total of 113 RCTs involving 8,514 children and adolescents were included. Meta-analysis results showed that exercise significantly improved body mass index (BMI; mean difference [MD]: -1.16 kg m<sup>-2</sup>, P < 0.00001), waist circumference (WC; MD: -2.29 cm, P < 0.00001), body fat percentage (BF%; MD: -2.07%, P < 0.00001) in RCTs on the effects of exercise on anthropometric outcomes among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity were retrieved. The subgroup results showed that national income status was a common source of heterogeneity for BMI (P < 0.0001), WC (P = 0.02), and BF% (P = 0.003).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Exercise improves anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents who are overweight or obese. Moderate-to-low-intensity aerobic exercise (≥ 3 sessions/week, ≥ 50 min/session, ≥ 12 weeks) as well as programs conducted in middle-income countries are more effective. Future studies need to deepen stratified research through a standardized design, integrate psychological support to improve intervention accuracy and compliance, and accurately implement policies to promote low-cost health interventions and cross-sectoral collaboration.",2025,[],[]
Secreted proteins in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: from bench towards bedside.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a global epidemic, yet effective pharmacological treatments remain limited. Secreted proteins play diverse roles in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and their dysregulation is implicated in the development of various metabolic diseases, including MASLD. Therefore, targeting secreted proteins and modulating associated signaling pathways represents a promising therapeutic strategy for MASLD. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the roles of emerging families of secreted proteins in MASLD and related metabolic disorders. These include the orosomucoid (ORM) family, secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein (SPARC) family, neuregulin (Nrg) family, growth differentiation factor (GDF) family, interleukin (IL) family, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, bone morphogenic protein (BMP) family, as well as isthmin-1 (Ism1) and mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF). The review highlights their impact on glucose and lipid metabolism and discusses the clinical potential of targeting these secreted proteins as a therapeutic approach for MASLD.",2025,"['acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein', 'sparc', 'neuregulin', 'nrg', 'growth differentiation factor', 'gdf', 'interleukin', 'il', 'fibroblast growth factor', 'fgf', 'bone morphogenic protein', 'bmp', 'isthmin - 1', 'is', '##m1', 'mesencephalic astrocyte - derived neurotrophic factor', 'manf']","['sparc', 'neuregulin', 'gdf', 'interleukin', 'fibroblast growth factor', 'fgf', 'bmp', 'isthmin 1', 'mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor', 'manf']"
Overexpression of Myl2 Inspires Thermogenic Potential of BAT by Enhancing Adipogenic Differentiation of Brown Adipose Derived Stem Cells.,"Obesity arises from a prolonged state of energy intake exceeding energy expenditure, leading to the ""whitening"" of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and a decline in metabolic function. To investigate factors contributing to BAT whitening in mice, we used microarray analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in brown adipose-derived stem cells (BADSCs) of wild-type (WT) and ob/ob mice. By intersecting differentially expressed genes between BADSCs and white adipose-derived stem cells (WADSCs) in WT mice, we identified Myl2 as a key gene in BAT function. Myl2 expression showed a 120.8-fold change between ob/ob and WT BADSCs, which was validated by in vivo BAT and in vitro BADSC experiments. Downregulation of Myl2 expression by inhibitor administration significantly reduced the differentiation capacity of BADSCs. Furthermore, overexpression of Myl2 in vitro through adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction promoted the differentiation of obese mouse-derived BADSCs into brown adipocytes. We further demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Myl2 by administering local injections of Myl2-expressing adeno-associated virus specifically for adipose tissue in ob/ob mice, resulting in improved brown adipose activity and energy metabolism. In summary, this study highlighted the crucial role of Myl2 in BADSC differentiation and BAT function, providing a potential therapeutic target for obesity treatment.",2025,"['myl2', 'myl2', 'myl2', 'myl2', 'myl2', 'myl2', 'myl2']",['myl2']
Nobiletin Modulates Adipocyte-Derived Exosomal miRNA to Improve Liver Lipid Metabolism in Obese Mice.,"This study examines the antiobesity properties of nobiletin through its influence on extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes. Nob-ELVs (nobiletin with adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles) significantly reduce fat accumulation in adipocytes without compromising cell viability. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that introducing Nob-ELVs to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes led to marked reductions in fat accumulation. RNA sequencing indicated that Nobiletin alters the exosomal miRNA profile, downregulating miR-802-5p and others while upregulating miR-574-5p and related miRNAs. In a high-fat diet mouse model, Nob-ELVs prevented significant weight gain and improved food conversion efficiency. Mice receiving Nob-ELVs exhibited reduced hepatic lipid droplet accumulation and altered protein expressions, enhancing SIRT1 and FGF21 while suppressing ACC, FASN, and CD36. These findings suggest that Nob-ELVs inhibit fat accumulation and enhance lipid metabolism by modulating exosomal miRNAs, offering insights for new obesity treatment strategies.",2025,"['##biletin', 'nobiletin', 'nobiletin', 'mir - 802 - 5p', 'mir - 574 - 5p', 'sirt1', 'fgf21', 'a', 'fasn', 'cd36']","['nobiletin', 'sirt1', 'fgf21', 'fasn', 'cd36']"
Epigenetic Programming of Estrogen Receptor in Adipose Tissue by High Fat Diet Regulates Obesity-Induced Inflammation,"Adipose inflammation plays a key role in obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities. Epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, is a molecular link between environmental factors and complex diseases. Here we found that high fat diet (HFD) feeding induced a dynamic change of DNA methylome in mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) analyzed by reduced representative bisulfite sequencing. Interestingly, DNA methylation at the promoter of estrogen receptor α ( Esr1 ) was significantly increased by HFD, concomitant with a down-regulation of Esr1 expression. HFD feeding in mice increased the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( Dnmt1 ) and Dnmt3a, and binding of DNMT1 and DNMT3a to Esr1 promoter in WAT. Mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt1 deficiency displayed increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity upon HFD challenge; while mice with adipocyte-specific Dnmt3a deficiency showed a mild metabolic phenotype. Using a modified CRISPR/RNA-guided system to specifically target DNA methylation at the Esr1 promoter in WAT, we found that reducing DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter increased Esr1 expression, decreased adipose inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-challenged mice. Our study demonstrates that DNA methylation at Esr1 promoter plays an important role in regulating adipose inflammation, which may contribute to obesity-induced insulin resistance.",2025,"['estrogen receptor α', 'esr1', 'esr1', 'dna methyltransferase 1', 'dnmt1', 'dnmt3a', 'dnmt1', 'dnmt3a', 'esr1 promoter', 'd', '##nmt1', 'esr1', 'insulin', 'dnmt3a', 'esr1 promoter', 'esr1 promoter', 'esr1', 'insulin', 'esr1 promoter', 'insulin']","['estrogen receptor alpha', 'esr1', 'dna methyltransferase 1', 'dnmt1', 'dnmt3a', 'insulin']"
Mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling activity in the human placenta across gestation and in maternal obesity†.,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin system is vital to placental development, formation, and function. Alterations in this system in the placenta have been associated with altered fetal growth. However, changes in placental mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling across gestation are poorly understood. We collected 81 human placental samples from 4 to 40 weeks gestation to test the hypothesis that placental mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling activity increases over gestation and is activated in maternal obesity in early gestation. Proteins involved in upstream mechanistic target of rapamycin regulation and mTORC1/2 downstream signaling were quantified using immunoblotting in placentas of male or female fetuses. Readouts of mTORC1 activation, phospho-rpS6, and phospho-4EBP1 were highest in first trimester and decreased across gestation. Phosphorylation of AKT (308 and 473) increased over gestation. Interestingly, abundance of cytochrome c oxidase I and mitochondrial ATP synthase, key subunits of mitochondrial complexes III/IV and V, respectively, were elevated in first trimester obese placentas compared to control, but only in placenta from female fetuses. We suggest that the high placental mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling activity in early pregnancy may be related to the high anabolism and active trophoblast proliferation and invasion in the second half of the first trimester. In addition, we conclude that maternal obesity has only limited impact on this key placental signaling pathway across gestation in women.",2025,"['mtorc1 / 2', 'mtorc1', 'p', '##hospho - rps6', 'phospho - 4ebp1', 'akt ( 308 and 473 )', 'cytochrome c oxidase i', 'mitochondrial atp synthase', 'mitochondrial complexes iii / iv and v']","['mtorc1', 'mitochondrial atp synthase']"
"Interplay of obesity and parasitic infection: current evidence of immunogenesis, tumorigenesis and leptin receptor involvement.","<h4>Background</h4>Parasitic infections possess comparable risk factors to obesity. In addition, obesity impairs innate and adaptive immunity subsequently increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases.<h4>Aim</h4>The study investigated the leptin/leptin receptors, obesity-parasites mutual relationship and the effect of parasitic infections on immune metabolism, microbiota, and tumorigenesis in the context of obesity.<h4>Methodology</h4>To implement the current review, articles were gathered using the Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB), Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Leptin enhances anti-parasitic immunity. Obesity favors intestinal colonization of Blastocystis sp., Dientamoeba fragilis, Entamoeba coli, and Giardia intestinalis. Adipocytes act as a niche and a food source for Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Plasmodium. In addition, Toxoplasma gondii relies on the circulatory cholesterol to thrive. Obesity provokes low-grade chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Yet, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Fasciola hepatica attempted to alleviate inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Hookworm improves insulin resistance. However, parasites such as Schistosoma mansoni, Trichuris suis, Taenia pisiformis, Entamoeba histolytica, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei, and Toxoplasma aggravated metabolic immune metabolic syndrome. Obesity hampered immunity against Leishmania sp.. and Plasmodium sp. is diabetogenic. Giardia infection and Heligmosoides polygyrus infections induce dysbiosis in obesity. Obesity and parasites like Trichomonas vaginalis, S. haematobium, S. mansoni, Clonorchis sinensis, Opishorchis viverrini showed similar cancer types. Yet, Toxoplasma gondii and Echinococcus granulosus have anti-tumorigenic effects. Obesity/high-fat diet hinders Schistosoma mansoni, Trichuris muris, and Entamoeba histolytica infections. Also, Blastocystis sp., Dientamoeba fragilis, Giardia intestinalis, Trichinella spiralis, and Schistosoma appeared to have ameliorative effects in obesity.",2025,"['leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'insulin']","['leptin', 'insulin']"
Pharmacological inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 decreases high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice,"<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity in both humans and rodent models. Our previous work demonstrated that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of GRK5 suppresses 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Here, we assessed the small-molecule GRK5 inhibitor, GRK5-IN-2, for its effects on metabolic tissues and therapeutic potential in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Mice were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by continued a high-fat diet with oral administration of GRK5-IN-2 (25 or 50 mg/kg) or water vehicle, five days per week for an additional 16 weeks. GRK5-IN-2 treatment had no effect on body weight, fat/lean mass, insulin tolerance, food intake, or energy expenditure but significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation and de novo lipogenesis. A follow-up study using 25 mg/kg of GRK5-IN-2 confirmed no effect on adiposity but reduced hepatic triglycerides. GRK5-IN-2 treatment decreased expression of the lipogenic gene Acc2 while upregulating lipid utilization proteins COXIV and ACSL1 in the liver, likely contributing to lower triglyceride levels. Together, these findings suggest that GRK5 inhibition selectively modulates hepatic lipid metabolism without altering systemic metabolic parameters, highlighting GRK5 as a potential therapeutic target for fatty liver disease.",2025,"['g protein - coupled receptor kinase 5', 'grk5', 'grk5', 'grk5', 'grk5 - in - 2', 'grk5 - in - 2', 'grk5 - in - 2', 'insulin', 'grk5 - in - 2', 'grk5 - in - 2', 'gene acc2', 'coxiv', 'acsl1', 'grk5', 'grk5']","['g protein coupled receptor kinase 5', 'grk5', 'insulin', 'coxiv', 'acsl1']"
"Multidimensional Determinants of Obesity: The Role of Life Purpose, Sociodemographics, and Health Habits Across Four Adiposity Scales in a Large Occupational Cohort.","<b>Background:</b> Obesity is multifactorial, shaped by biological, behavioral, and psychosocial factors. Traditional sociodemographic and lifestyle influences are well studied, but psychological well-being, particularly life purpose, remains less explored. This study investigates associations between demographics, health behaviors, and life purpose and obesity prevalence, assessed through four validated adiposity indices in Spanish workers. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study included 93,077 workers (mean age: 43.8 ± 9.6 years; 54.1% men). Obesity was defined according to four measures: body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), Clínica Universidad de Navarra Body Adiposity Estimator (CUN-BAE), and Metabolic Score for Visceral Fat (METS-VF). Sociodemographic, lifestyle (Mediterranean diet, physical activity, smoking), and psychological (Purpose in Life Test, PIL-10) variables were assessed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with obesity risk. <b>Results:</b> Low life purpose was significantly associated with increased odds of obesity across all indices, particularly for CUN-BAE (OR = 4.58; 95% CI: 3.99-6.28) and BMI (OR = 5.45; 95% CI: 4.71-6.30). Traditional risk factors such as physical inactivity, poor adherence to the Mediterranean diet, older age, a lower social class, and smoking also demonstrated strong associations with higher adiposity levels. METS-VF showed the greatest sensitivity to male sex and unhealthy behaviors. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study identifies life purpose as an independent psychosocial determinant of obesity. Using multiple adiposity measures strengthens the findings, emphasizing psychological well-being in prevention. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm causality and develop interventions enhancing life purpose to improve cardiometabolic health. Given the cross-sectional design, causal inferences cannot be drawn and the directionality of associations remains uncertain.",2025,[],[]
Predicting HbA1c Target Achievement in Type 2 Diabetes: A Retrospective Single-Centre Nomogram Derived From National MMC-Standardised Management.,"<h4>Background</h4>This study assessed the effectiveness of standardized management implemented by the National Metabolic Management Center (MMC) for patients with type 2 diabetes. The goal was to develop a nomogram for predicting HbA1c target achievement.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective single-centre study was conducted, including 853 type 2 diabetes patients enrolled in the National Standardized Metabolic Disease Management Center at the Third People's Hospital of Datong City from June 2019 to June 2020. After one year of MMC's standardized management, factors influencing HbA1c achievement were identified through univariate and multivariate analyses to establish a predictive model. Missing data were handled using appropriate imputation methods. Model accuracy and performance were assessed using internal validation and ROC curve analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Significant improvements were observed following MMC's standardized management, including reductions in SBP, FBG, Hb, HCT, MPV, γ-GT, ALB, TG, TC, HbA1c, and LDL-c levels (P<0.05), and increases in AST, BUN, Cr, UA, and HDL-c levels (P<0.05). The absolute HbA1c level decreased, and the rate of achieving the HbA1c target (<7%) was significantly enhanced (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis identified FBG and HCT as independent protective factors for HbA1c achievement, while ALB was a risk factor. The developed predictive model exhibited favorable discriminative ability (c-index: 0.747, 95% CI: 0.703-0.790), confirmed by decision curve analysis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Standardized MMC management may guide care for type 2 diabetes patients.

Prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes among primary health care attendees in the West bank of Palestine: a cross-sectional study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Prediabetes represents a major global health challenge with substantial implications for population health. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of prediabetes among attendees at Palestinian primary health care (PHC) centers and identify associated factors.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was conducted in PHC centers in the West Bank from February to June 2024. A total of 635 participants, representing both sexes, were recruited from six PHC centers, two from each of the three main regions of the West Bank, including one central and one peripheral center per region. Prediabetes was diagnosed through HbA1c testing. Associated factors were assessed through face-to-face interviews using the validated Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire (CANRISK).<h4>Results</h4>The overall prevalence of prediabetes among PHC attendees was 13.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 11.0-16.3%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified several factors significantly associated with prediabetes. These included central obesity (adjusted Odss Ratio (aOR) = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.3-13.9), male sex (aOR = 4.5; 95% CI: 2.1-9.7), older age (aOR = 24.1; 95% CI: 7.9-73.7), and a family history of diabetes (aOR = 4.3; 95% CI: 1.6-12.2). Additional significant variables included unemployment (aOR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.15-4.9), physical inactivity (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4.1), and irregular consumption of fruits and vegetables (aOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.9-5.7).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study reveals a significant prevalence of prediabetes among Palestinian PHC attendees, with central obesity, male sex, older age, and family history of diabetes emerging as key associated factors.

Muscle Type-Specific Modulation of Autophagy Signaling in Obesity: Effects of Caloric Restriction and Exercise.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity causes metabolic dysregulation and contributes to diseases, and autophagy plays a pivotal role in that process. In mice, autophagy, a cellular recycling mechanism, is influenced by factors beyond obesity, including caloric restriction (CR) and CR combined with voluntary wheel running (CR+Ex). However, the regulation of autophagy in skeletal muscle during obesity, CR, and CR+Ex remains poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>Mice (n=42) were randomly divided into six groups: normal diet, normal diet CR, normal diet CR+Ex, high-fat diet, high-fat diet CR, and high-fat diet CR+Ex. All mice were fed <i>ad libitum</i> with either a normal or high-fat diet for the first 4 months, followed by the respective interventions for the subsequent 4 months. Body composition, motor function, and autophagy signaling were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Obesity resulted in increased total mass, lean mass, fat mass, and fat percentage in tissue and decreased grip strength and endurance capacity. Notably, CR+Ex reduced total mass, lean mass, and fat mass in obese mice. In both the normal and obese conditions, the expression of the autophagy markers p62, light chain 3B (LC3B)-I, and LC3B-II was significantly higher in red muscle than white muscle. Obesity led to a reduction in cathepsin L expression, and CR further increased LC3B-I expression in red muscle.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CR+Ex was an effective strategy for counteracting the adverse changes in body composition associated with obesity. Compared with red muscle, white muscle exhibits lower autophagy-related protein levels and might require elevated cathepsin L expression to mitigate the negative effects of obesity.",2025,"['p62', 'light chain 3b (', 'lc3b ) - i', 'lc3b - ii', 'cathepsin l', 'lc3b - i', 'cathepsin l']","['p62', 'cathepsin l']"
Cross-regulation between adipose tissue innervation and metaflammation: a potential therapeutic target for obesity.,"Obesity, marked by adipose tissue dysfunction and systemic metaflammation, poses a major global health burden. Emerging evidence underscores a critical interplay between neural regulation and immune-metabolic crosstalk in obesity pathogenesis. This review highlights the dynamic roles of sympathetic and sensory nerves in lipid metabolism, as well as metaflammation involving macrophage polarization, inflammatory cytokine cascades, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In obesity, decreased sympathetic nerve density and impaired adrenergic receptor signaling compromise lipolysis and thermogenesis, while sensory neuropeptides worsen metabolic dysregulation through immune cell interactions. Adipose tissue macrophages adopt pro-inflammatory phenotypes, releasing cytokines that inhibit insulin signaling - forming pathological crown-like structures. Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by excessive fission and reduced fusion, disrupts energy homeostasis and increases oxidative stress. Therapeutic approaches targeting neuropeptide signaling, inflammasome activation, and mitochondrial dynamics show promise in restoring metabolic balance. The neuro-immune-metabolic axis thus represents a novel therapeutic frontier for obesity, supporting integrated strategies targeting neural, inflammatory, and mitochondrial pathways.",2025,"['adrenergic receptor', 'insulin']","['adrenergic receptor', 'insulin']"
Adipose-Derived Exosomes: mediators of crosstalk between Adipose tissue and cancer.,"Adipose-derived exosomes (ADEs), a subtype of extracellular vesicles, are critical mediators of communication between adipose tissue and tumors, playing pivotal roles in cancer progression and therapeutic response. These nanoscale vesicles carry microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that influence tumor cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and immune modulation. The dual functions of ADEs - both in promoting and suppressing tumorigenesis - are largely dependent on their cellular origin, molecular cargo, and the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have identified ADEs as potential diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and drug delivery platforms, offering promising avenues for precision oncology. However, significant challenges - such as biological heterogeneity, lack of standardization in production, concerns regarding efficacy and safety, and regulatory constraints - continue to hinder their clinical translation. This review aimed to explore the multifaceted roles of ADEs in cancer pathogenesis, their therapeutic potential, and current limitations, providing insights to guide future research and clinical applications.",2025,[],[]
Role of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs) in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used in the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity due to their metabolic benefits.

In the context of heart failure (HF), particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), GLP-1RAs have been associated with improvement in symptoms, physical capacity, biomarkers, and structural cardiac remodeling. These benefits appear to be independent of weight loss, suggesting additional mechanisms including anti-inflammatory effects, improved myocardial metabolism or modulation of epicardial adipose tissue. However, current data largely come from non-HF dedicated trials, with limited standardization of the HF phenotype. Results are overall inconsistent and may suggest potential harm in some cases, particularly in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This review aims to summarize the current evidence on the role of GLP-1RAs in heart failure, explore possible underlying mechanisms and highlight key gaps in knowledge.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1ras']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
Exosome-Derived miR-11987 in Bovine Milk Inhibits Obesity Through Browning of White Fat.,"The global obese population accounts for approximately 30% of the total population and continues to increase. White adipocytes, which accumulate in the body for energy storage, are associated with obesity. Mechanisms that activate browning of white adipocytes are an attractive therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic disorders. Exosomes are nano-sized biovesicles that play a role in cell-to-cell communication though the transfer of cargos such as microRNAs. Although milk exosomes contain many endogenous microRNA molecules, the role of microRNAs in milk exosomes is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of milk exosomes on the browning of white adipocyte. Mouse pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1) and human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were differentiated and exposed to milk exosomes. Compared to control, milk exosomes promoted the expression of thermogenic genes and cellular mitochondrial energy metabolism in both 3T3-L1 cells and hADSCs. Additionally, milk exosomes were orally administered to mice fed a high-fat diet. As the intake of milk exosomes increased, the mice's body weight decreased. Milk exosomes also increased the protein levels of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial-related genes in mouse adipose tissue. The overexpression of miR-11987, which is abundant in milk exosomes, in both 3T3-L1 cells and hADSCs led to the increased expression of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial activity. Our results support that bovine-specific miR-11987 in milk exosomes promotes the browning of white adipocytes. Therefore, milk exosome and milk exosomal miR-11987 could have significant clinical implications for obesity and metabolic syndrome.",2025,"['mir - 11987', 'bovine - specific mir - 11987', 'milk exosomal mir -', '##7']",[]

Prospective Observational Case Series in Infertile Women with Overweight or Obesity Treated with a Very-Low Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) Prior to an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Treatment.,"<b>Background:</b> Elevated BMI in women is linked to metabolic and endocrine imbalances that impair fertility and increase pregnancy risks. While >10% weight loss before an Assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment may improve outcomes, sustained results through conventional diets are challenging. A very-low calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) promotes rapid fat loss while preserving lean mass and may offer long-term benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy (≥10% weight loss without lean mass reduction), adherence, metabolic effects, and pregnancy outcomes of a meal replacement VLCKD in women with overweight or obesity scheduled for ART. <b>Methods:</b> This monocentric, prospective case-series was conducted at the Obesity and Work Center, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan (September 2019-September 2023). Eligible women underwent a three-phase dietary program: a 3-month VLCKD (<800 kcal/day), a 6-month transition with gradual carbohydrate reintroduction, and a Mediterranean-style maintenance diet. Participants were monitored for safety, body composition, adherence, and biochemical changes. <b>Results:</b> Of 52 women enrolled, 40 initiated the VLCKD; 27 (68%) achieved ≥10% weight loss while preserving lean mass. Eleven conceived naturally during or after the diet; 22 underwent ART, with 12 additional pregnancies. This corresponds to a 58% pregnancy rate among those who began the VLCKD. Significant improvements were observed in body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, and liver function. No adverse events were reported. <b>Conclusions:</b> A meal replacement VLCKD protocol is feasible, well-tolerated, and associated with significant improvements in weight, especially in body composition, metabolic health, and potentially outcomes in women with overweight or obesity awaiting ART.",2025,[],[]
Association Between Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Metabolic Syndrome and Its Components Among Polish Postmenopausal Women: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The decrease in estrogen levels during menopause is associated with an increase in visceral fat accumulation, which can contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). While some studies have suggested a link between the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and the reduced incidence of MetS and its components in the general population, these findings have not been confirmed among postmenopausal women. Therefore, this study investigated the association between the adherence to the MedDiet and the odds of having MetS, and established the food groups responsible for this effect in postmenopausal women. <b>Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study involved 312 postmenopausal women who underwent anthropometric measurements and blood parameter assessment. Adherence to the MedDiet was assessed using the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score (the aMED score), and MetS was defined based on the updated 2022 criteria. <b>Results</b>: After adjusting for potential confounders, adherence to the MedDiet was inversely associated with central obesity and hypertension. For each one-point increase in the aMED score (indicating a better adherence to the MedDet), the odds of central obesity and hypertension were significantly reduced by 33% (OR = 0.669, 95% CI: 0.518; 0.866, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and by 18% (OR = 0.817, 95% CI: 0.689; 0.969, <i>p</i> = 0.020), respectively. A greater consumption of nuts and fish was associated with lower odds of central obesity (OR = 0.972, 95% CI: 0.950; 0.995; <i>p</i> = 0.016) and (OR = 0.989, 95%CI: 0.979; 1.000; <i>p</i> = 0.043), respectively, whereas high processed red meat consumption was associated with hypertension (OR = 1.004, 95% CI: 1.000; 1.008, <i>p</i> = 0.048). <b>Conclusions</b>: A greater adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower odds of central obesity and hypertension among postmenopausal women; however, it did not translate to a reduced likelihood of having MetS. A higher consumption of nuts and fish was associated with lower odds of central obesity, whereas a higher consumption of red, processed meats was associated with higher odds of hypertension. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the causality of these relationships.",2025,[],[]
Review: Special Issue: &lt;i&gt;Real-world evidence on the use of GLP1 receptor agonists&lt;/i&gt;: Emerging concepts in obesity management: focus on glucagon receptor agonist combinations.,"The global rise in obesity and its associated health risks has driven the need for more effective pharmacological treatments. Glucagon receptor (GCGR)-based multi-agonist drugs are emerging as promising treatments for obesity, with several in advanced stages of clinical development. Agents like mazdutide, pemvidutide, survodutide and retatrutide have demonstrated the ability to trigger significant weight loss in earlier phase trials, often surpassing the amount of weight loss obtained with existing therapies. Their potential to address obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, positions them as important additions to future obesity treatment guidelines. As these GCGR-based multi-agonists advance through clinical trials, their impact on obesity management may be substantial, particularly for patients who have not achieved success with current medications or lifestyle interventions. Some are also being evaluated for cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting their relevance in populations at high risk with overweight and obesity. Key considerations as these drugs move forward in development to eventual approval include cost, access and long-term safety.

"Dietary Branched-Chain Amino Acids Restriction in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice: Effects on Metabolic Homeostasis, Adipose Inflammation, and Gut Microbiota.","<h4>Background</h4>Numerous studies implicate a strong association between elevated circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and obesity and related disorders. However, whether this association is causal, and if disrupted BCAA homeostasis can serve as a therapeutic target for obesity-related diseases remain to be established experimentally.<h4>Objectives</h4>We aimed to explore the long-term effects of BCAAs restriction on lipid and glucose metabolism, adipose inflammation, and gut microbiota in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.<h4>Methods</h4>Three-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into 3 groups and received a semi-purified ingredient control diet, HFD, or HFD with 50% BCAAs restriction for 24 wk. Body weight, fasting serum BCAAs, glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and glucose tolerance were measured. Inflammation markers and macrophage infiltration in epididymal adipose tissue, as well as gut microbiota profiling, were conducted. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.<h4>Results</h4>HFD feeding significantly increased circulating leucine, isoleucine, valine, and total BCAAs levels by 31%, 27%, 19%, and 25%, respectively, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the HFD group, dietary BCAA restriction significantly decreased circulating leucine, isoleucine, and total BCAAs levels by 21%, 17%, and 16%, respectively (P < 0.05). However, this reduction was not sufficient to improve glucose and lipid homeostasis, except for a significant 20% reduction in serum LDL levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, BCAA restriction failed to decrease white adipose tissue mass index or alleviate epididymal adipose tissue inflammation HFD-fed mice. Interestingly, BCAAs restriction ameliorated HFD-induced gut microbiota disorder by downregulating the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (P < 0.05) and reducing the relative abundance of obesity-linked bacteria, such as Lactococcus and Oscillibacter (P < 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Collectively, the results suggest that although BCAA restriction may have limited benefits on HFD-induced obesity and metabolic disorders in mice, it improves gut microbiota dysbiosis.",2025,"['b', 'serum bcaas', 'insulin', 'low - density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'high - density lipoprotein cholester', 'serum ldl', 'b', 'b']","['insulin', 'low density lipoprotein cholesterol']"
Long-term trends in obesity and overweight in women in Ghana from 2003-2023.,"<h4>Background</h4>In Ghana, overweight and obesity prevalence among women (20-49 years) reached 50% in 2022, increasing from 40% in 2014. This study aims to understand what has driven previous trends in overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Ghana and to predict future trends that can help inform policy making and public health surveillance.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) containing information on women of reproductive age (aged 15 to 49 years). Data collected between 2003 and 2022 provided cohorts born between 1953 and 2007. Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis was used to disentangle the effects of age, time, and generation on trends in the odds of obesity and overweight.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of overweight and obesity increases during the study period, especially with age, in all cohorts. In the APC analysis, the odds of obesity increase with age until age 42-43 years (odds ratio (OR): 9.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.63-15.59, compared to 20-21 year olds) before levelling out. Accounting for age and birth cohort, the odds of overweight and obesity increase significantly over time between 2003 and 2015 (overweight OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.47-2.11, obesity OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.77-2.91), after which the effect levels out and appears to stabilise. There is no effect of birth cohort on the odds of overweight or obesity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although high, the increasing odds of obesity and overweight in Ghana appears to be stabilising. However, the increasing odds of obesity with age, suggest that an ageing population could mean that the prevalence will increase into the future.",2025,[],[]
UCP1 Mitigates Hepatic Steatosis and Fibrosis Independent of Cold Exposure,"Non-shivering thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising target for anti-obesity therapies, making its regulatory mechanisms of significant translational interest. While cold-induced BAT thermogenesis (CIT) is well characterized, certain high-calorie diets can also activate BAT in the absence of cold, a process known as diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Despite its potential relevance to modern human diets and lifestyles, the mechanisms and physiological relevance underlying DIT remain poorly understood. Here, we show that DIT reduces adiposity and protects against hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in males but not female mice. Moreover, adipose tissue-specific ablation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) reveals that BAT is the primary mediator of DIT but that non-adipocyte UCP1 also contributes to body weight regulation. Transcriptome analysis suggests that DIT is triggered by intrinsic metabolic stress, distinguishing it from CIT, which is driven by sympathetic tone. Finally, BAT-specific arteriovenous metabolomics identifies glucose as the predominant circulating fuel for DIT. These findings uncover distinct molecular and metabolic features of DIT, highlighting opportunities to harness BAT activity for treating obesity and metabolic diseases without requiring cold exposure.",2025,"['dit', 'dit', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'ucp1', 'dit', 'dit', 'dit']","['dit', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
Differential Roles of Coding and Non-Coding Transcripts in Obesity: Insights from RNA-Seq Analysis of Macaca Fascicularis Hepatocytes,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate metabolism-associated genes and cooperate to activate obesity-related pathways. However, the role of lncRNAs in obesity-related diabetes is not clear. To address this, we analyzed the hepatic transcriptomes of diabetic and non-diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our findings demonstrate that coding and non-coding RNAs exhibit distinct patterns of expression, with coding mRNAs notably enriched for metabolic pathways and particularly lipid transport. At the same time, the expression of genes related to alcohol metabolism was suppressed in diabetic samples compared with normal samples. This study expands the understanding of the molecular underpinnings behind obesity and suggests possible avenues for precision treatment approaches that target metabolic diseases.</p>",2025,[],[]
IMPROVE 2023: The 2nd International Meeting on Pathway-Related Obesity: Vision &amp; Evidence.,"A total of 150 clinicians and researchers representing 19 countries came together in person and online to participate in the highly anticipated 2nd International Meeting on Pathway-Related Obesity: Vision & Evidence (IMPROVE), held on 13-15 December 2023 in Paris, France. Building on the success of the inaugural event in 2022, this gathering served as a pivotal platform for attendees to delve into the latest scientific and clinical developments in hyperphagia and early-onset obesity caused by rare melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway disease. The central objective of the meeting was to explore the complexities of MC4R pathway-related diseases and generate opportunities for collaborative dialogue among delegates for the advancement of this field. The event unfolded across three distinct sessions, with a dedicated focus on monogenic MC4R pathway disease, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and hypothalamic obesity, together with a discussion on the future of the field. Additionally, the agenda featured three insightful workshops designed to facilitate in-depth discussions. One workshop focused on the genetics of monogenic MC4R pathway diseases, another scrutinised the genetics of BBS and the final workshop examined patient management through the exploration of clinical cases. As we reflect on the wealth of information disseminated and the collaborative spirit that permeated the meeting, it becomes clear that IMPROVE 2023 was not merely an assembly of professionals; it was a forum where the future of research in rare MC4R pathway diseases and patient care took centre stage.

Metabolic cost of external work: a novel CPET parameter optimises characterisation of exercise performance in obese individuals.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Both obesity and cardiorespiratory fitness are crucial determinants of symptoms and prognosis. However, interpreting the gold-standard cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is complicated by increasing body size and varying body composition. We hypothesised that the 'metabolic cost of external work' (or oxygen uptake (ml/min)/workload (Watts); V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W), a body weight-independent determinant of endurance capacity, would reflect metabolic health more accurately than V̇O<sub>2</sub> alone.<h4>Methods</h4>A test cohort of 160 fit individuals underwent anthropomorphic and metabolic assessment, maximal bicycle ergometer CPET, and six-minute walk test (6MWT). V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W was calculated at VT1 and peak. The performance of V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W was validated in 62 older, less fit individuals, undergoing the same protocol. 24 obese volunteers were assigned a weight loss intervention, and the impact on V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W examined.<h4>Results</h4>In both test and validation cohort, V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W at VT1 and peak correlated with 6MWT distance, more strongly than standard CPET parameters. Including V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W improved the accuracy of predicting 6MWT distance. V̇O<sub>2</sub>/W correlated with BMI, insulin sensitivity and waist-to-hip ratio. Metabolic cost falls with weight loss, in parallel to metabolic and functional improvements, in contrast to other CPET parameters.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Metabolic cost is strongly associated with functional capacity and metabolic health across a range of body weight and fitness, outperforming standard CPET metrics. It is a simple measure which may improve our assessment of the extent to which exertional symptoms are determined by metabolic factors in an individual, and thereby target the most appropriate intervention to those who will benefit most.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
"If the evidence is there, why are GLP-1 receptor agonists not on-label for hip and knee osteoarthritis in overweight patients?","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have rapidly emerged as highly effective pharmacological tools for weight management, with additional cardiometabolic benefits extending beyond obesity and diabetes. Despite compelling evidence, their potential role in osteoarthritis (OA) remains unrecognized in current regulatory frameworks. Hip and knee OA, leading causes of disability and healthcare burden worldwide, are strongly influenced by both biomechanical overload and systemic metabolic-inflammatory pathways. Increasing data support the dual capacity of GLP-1 RAs to achieve clinically meaningful weight reduction and to exert direct anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects within the joint. The STEP 9 trial and complementary real-world evidence demonstrate substantial improvements in OA symptoms, paralleled by reductions in surgical risk, while ongoing trials such as STOP-KNEE OA will further clarify their structural impact. Importantly, patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27-29.9 kg/m²-currently excluded from GLP-1 RA eligibility unless additional comorbidities are present-may particularly benefit, as weight loss beyond 7-10% appears necessary to meaningfully alter OA trajectories. Recognizing symptomatic hip and knee OA as weight-related comorbidities would align regulatory labels with emerging science, expand therapeutic access, and foster integrated management of musculoskeletal and metabolic diseases. This Viewpoint argues that failure to acknowledge OA as an on-label indication for GLP-1 RAs represents a missed opportunity for patients, clinicians, and health systems.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 r', 'glp - 1 ras']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
The Adipose Tissue-Derived Secretome (ADS) in Obesity Uniquely Regulates the Na-Glucose Transporter SGLT1 in Intestinal Epithelial Cells.,"Obesity is a complex chronic inflammatory condition that results from excess fat accumulation. It increases the risk of developing numerous co-morbidities such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and stroke. The adipose tissue is itself a vital endocrine organ that secretes numerous adipokines, cytokines, and exosomes, which are collectively known as the adipose-derived secretome (ADS). This ADS has been shown to influence and modulate many physiological processes. During obesity, the composition of ADS is altered, which may contribute to the development of obesity-associated diseases. Type-2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most common complications of obesity due to alterations in glucose homeostasis. Glucose absorption occurs via Na-glucose co-transport via SGLT1 at the brush border membrane (BBM) of small intestinal villus cells. This process of transepithelial glucose uptake is the primary method of glucose absorption from diet. However, how ADS mediates the function of SGLT1 is not yet known. This study aims to determine the mechanism of regulation of SGLT1 by ADS in intestinal epithelial cells. We show that ADS from OZR (but not LZR) stimulates SGLT1 in IEC-18 cells. OZR-ADS treatment diminished Na/K-ATPase activity in IEC-18 cells. Kinetic studies indicated that the mechanism of stimulation for SGLT1 during OZR-ADS treatment was secondary to an increase in the affinity (1/K<sub>m</sub>) of the co-transporter for glucose without a change in co-transporter number. Western blot studies revealed that SGLT1 protein expression was unaltered in the two groups, confirming our kinetic studies. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that an increase in the affinity of the SGLT1 protein was mediated by altered phosphorylation. In conclusion, during obesity, the adipose tissue secretome stimulates SGLT1 in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to an increase in affinity for glucose. The affinity change is due to alterations in SGLT1 phosphorylation. Together, these results may provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying altered glucose homeostasis in obesity and how this may lead to the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2025,"['sglt1', 'sglt1', 'sglt1', 'ozr', 'lzr', 'sglt1', 'oz', 'na / k - atpase', 'sglt1', 'sglt1 protein', 'sglt1 protein', 'sglt1', 'sglt1']","['sglt1', 'sglt1 protein']"

"Lipid-Lowering Potential of Almond Hulls (Quercetin, Baicalein, and Kaempferol): Insights from Network Pharmacology and Molecular Dynamics.","The advancement of modern lifestyles has precipitated excessive consumption of energy-dense foods, driving the escalating global burden of lipid metabolism dysregulation-related pathologies-including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular disorders-which collectively pose a formidable challenge to global public health systems. The almond hull, as a by-product of almond processing, is rich in polyphenolic compounds with demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering potential, though its precise hypo-lipidemic mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, polyphenols were extracted from almond hulls using 50% ethanol with ultrasound-assisted extraction, followed by preliminary purification via solvent partitioning. The ethyl acetate fraction was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Network pharmacology and molecular docking were employed to investigate the interactions between key bioactive constituents (e.g., quercetin, baicalein, and kaempferol) and targets in lipid metabolism-related pathways. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further evaluated the stability of the lowest-energy complexes. Results revealed that the ethyl acetate fraction exhibited potent pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 204.2 µg/mL). At 0.1 mg/mL after 24 h treatment, it significantly reduced free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced intracellular triglyceride accumulation (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity. Network pharmacology and in vitro studies suggest almond hull extract modulates PI3K-AKT signaling and improves insulin resistance, demonstrating lipid-lowering effects.

A randomized controlled trial of once-weekly semaglutide for limiting post-smoking cessation weight gain in smokers with overweight/obesity: Study protocol.,"<h4>Background</h4>Smoking and obesity are the two leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. While smoking cessation has tremendous health benefits, most smokers gain weight post-cessation, which may partially attenuate these benefits. Semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) approved for weight management in adults with overweight/obesity, leads to clinically meaningful reductions in body weight and may thus have utility for preventing weight gain in the context of smoking cessation.<h4>Methods</h4>This parallel group, two-arm, double-blind clinical trial will randomize 177 treatment-seeking smokers with a body mass index of ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or ≥ 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with at least one weight-related comorbidity to semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly or placebo (2:1) for 28 weeks, including 16 weeks of semaglutide dose escalation, followed by 12 weeks at target, 2.4 mg, dose. Both groups will receive 10 weeks of nicotine patches (dose based on baseline number of cigarettes smoked daily) and brief individual smoking cessation counseling. The primary outcome is percent body weight change at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes are changes in total body weight and fat mass (kg) and waist circumference. Exploratory outcomes are changes in daily energy intake and food choices, food cravings and appetite/satiety, and smoking abstinence rates.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We anticipate that semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly will provide a clinically meaningful effect on weight management in the context of smoking cessation. If our hypotheses are confirmed, this GLP-1RA could move forward as a pharmacotherapeutic for helping smokers achieve abstinence without weight gain.

Combination Lorcaserin and Betahistine Treatment Improves Cognitive Dysfunction and Dopaminergic Neuron Activity in a Rat Model of Diet-Induced Obesity.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity is a complex disorder with both metabolic and neurocognitive consequences, including impairments in prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent learning and memory. Combination pharmacotherapy may offer a more effective approach for addressing obesity-induced cognitive deficits. <b>Objective:</b> This study evaluated the effects of 30-day co-administration of lorcaserin (5-HT<sub>2</sub>C agonist) and betahistine (H<sub>1</sub> agonist/H<sub>3</sub> antagonist) in reversing cognitive deficits in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) rat model. <b>Methods:</b> Male Lewis rats were subjected to DIO and administered lorcaserin (2 mg/kg) and betahistine (5 mg/kg), either alone or in combination, via intraperitoneally implanted osmotic minipumps for 30 days. Y-maze, novel object recognition, and object-in-place (OIP) tests were used to assess cognitive functions. In vivo electrophysiological recordings were employed to examine effects of the combination treatment on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neuron activity. <b>Results:</b> Obese Western-diet-fed rats showed lower discrimination scores in the OIP task, a behavioral test that engages PFC functions, while their performance in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tasks was similar to that of non-obese Control-diet-fed rats. Combination treatment with lorcaserin and betahistine significantly improved the OIP scores of obese rats. However, the combination treatment did not reduce body weight or obesity-associated morphometrical parameters. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a reduction in the number of spontaneously active dopaminergic neurons in the VTA of obese rats. Lorcaserin and betahistine co-treatment significantly increased the number of spontaneously active dopaminergic neurons of obese animals. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results demonstrate the potential of combination lorcaserin-betahistine treatment to reverse obesity-related cognitive deficits, possibly through enhancement of mesocortical dopaminergic neuron activity.",2025,[],[]
Weight Loss Efficacy of Tirzepatide Compared to Placebo or GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Adults With Obesity or Overweight: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials With ≥ 20 Weeks Treatment Duration.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue, is a novel medication with comparable pharmacological characteristics and has demonstrated promising weight reduction outcomes in its antidiabetic trials following the approval of liraglutide and semaglutide for long-term weight control. Nonetheless, this efficacy has not been fully explored, so this meta-analysis was aimed to measure the weight loss efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with overweight or obesity. <b>Methods:</b> We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for RCTs of once-weekly tirzepatide vs. placebo or GLP-1 receptor agonists. We included studies involving adult participants who were overweight or obese despite T2DM or OHA use, with a trial duration of at least 20 weeks. The primary outcomes accounted for the mean difference in weight from baseline in the three doses of tirzepatide compared to placebo and GLP-1 receptor agonists, separately. The secondary outcomes included safety profiles and achievement of categorical weight loss of 5%, 10% and 15%. We performed the statistical analysis on RevMan 5.4, GRADE assessment using GRADEpro GDT and the quality of the included studies assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (Version 2) tool. <b>Results:</b> We identified six RCTs in which the data of 6266 subjects were analysed. Once-weekly doses (5, 10 and 15 mg) of tirzepatide were more effective than placebo and GLP-1 RAs. Also, the proportion of patients achieving categorical weight loss goals was higher in the tirzepatide groups than in others. GRADE assessment also indicated high-certainty evidence for ≥ 15% weight loss with tirzepatide and moderate-to-low certainty for lower thresholds. Gastrointestinal side effects appeared similar between the three doses of tirzepatide and GLP-1 RAs, but they were significantly higher than placebo might impact tolerability for certain patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> A dose-dependent tirzepatide was superior to placebo and GLP-1 RAs in weight reduction. However, the lean mass reduction and tolerability require further investigation. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04255433.",2025,"['glucose - dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'gip', 'glucagon - like peptide 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras']","['glucose dependent insulinotropic peptide', 'gip', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'glp 1', 'glp 1 receptor']"
Efficacy of Dual Glucagon and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists Across the Cardiometabolic Continuum: A Review of Current Clinical Evidence.,"The global surge in cardiometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, has reached pandemic levels, demanding bold and innovative solutions. Dual glucagon (Gcg) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists represent a groundbreaking advancement in the treatment of this complex and interconnected spectrum of disorders. By harnessing the synergistic power of GLP-1 and Gcg receptor activation, these agents go beyond glucose lowering and weight loss, unlocking new frontiers in energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and liver fat reduction-key targets in conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Emerging clinical evidence on agents such as survodutide and cotadutide has revealed striking improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body weight, consistently outperforming traditional GLP-1 receptor agonists. More importantly, early evidence suggests meaningful benefits in cardiovascular and renal outcomes, positioning these therapies as comprehensive, disease-modifying tools for patients with multiple high-risk comorbidities. This review highlights the transformative potential of dual GLP-1/Gcg receptor agonists, providing a thorough examination of their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles across the cardio-metabolic continuum. As the limitations of existing therapies become increasingly evident, these next-generation agents are poised to redefine the standard of care across the cardiometabolic continuum, ushering in a new era of precision medicine for metabolic disease.",2025,"['glucagon', 'gcg', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glp - 1 ) receptor', 'glp - 1', 'gcg receptor', 'hemoglobin', 'hba1c', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1', 'gcg receptor']","['glucagon', 'gcg', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'glp 1', 'hemoglobin', 'hba1c', 'glp 1 receptor']"
Anti-Obesity Effects of &lt;i&gt;Abeliophyllum distichum&lt;/i&gt; Extracts via the AMPK Signaling Pathway in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.,"Obesity is a major public health concern because of its association with metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus) and cardiovascular diseases. Natural compounds are increasingly being explored as safer alternatives to synthetic antiobesity drugs. In this study, the antiobesity effects of <i>Abeliophyllum distichum</i> extracts in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and their underlying mechanisms were investigated. Oil Red O staining was employed to assess the effects of <i>A. distichum</i> extracts on adipogenesis and lipid accumulation, and Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the key molecular pathways were. Treatment with <i>A. distichum</i> extracts significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and suppressed the expression of adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, at the protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, treatment with <i>A. distichum</i> extracts activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and enhanced the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which are key regulators of cellular energy metabolism, while reducing the total ACC expression. These findings indicate that <i>A. distichum</i> extracts exert antiobesity effects by modulating the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibiting adipogenesis. Given these significant bioactive properties, <i>A. distichum</i> extracts have promising application potential as a natural therapeutic agent for treating obesity.",2025,"['peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma', 'ccaat / enhancer - binding protein alpha', 'sterol regulatory element - binding protein 1c', 'amp - activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'acetyl - coa carboxylase', 'acc', 'acc', 'ampk']","['peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma', 'amp activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'acetyl coa carboxylase', 'acc']"
The Role of Non-HDL Cholesterol and Apolipoprotein B in Cardiovascular Disease: A Comprehensive Review.,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, even in the era of aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. This persistent residual risk has prompted a reevaluation of atherogenic lipid markers, with non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) emerging as superior indicators of the total atherogenic particle burden. Unlike LDL-C, non-HDL-C includes cholesterol from all atherogenic lipoproteins, while Apo B reflects the total number of atherogenic particles regardless of cholesterol content. Their clinical relevance is underscored in populations with diabetes, obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia, where LDL-C may not adequately reflect cardiovascular risk. This review explores the biological, clinical, and genetic foundations of non-HDL-C and Apo B as critical tools for risk stratification and therapeutic targeting. It highlights discordance analysis, inflammatory mechanisms in atherogenesis, the influence of metabolic syndromes, and their utility in specific populations, including those with chronic kidney disease and children with familial hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, the role of lipoprotein (a), glycation in diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia are examined as contributors to residual risk. Clinical trials and genetic studies support Apo B and non-HDL-C as more robust predictors of cardiovascular events than LDL-C. Current guidelines increasingly endorse these markers as secondary or even preferred targets in complex lipid disorders. The incorporation of Apo B and non-HDL-C into routine clinical practice, especially for patients with residual risk, represents a paradigm shift toward personalized cardiovascular prevention. The review concludes with recommendations for guideline integration, emerging therapies, and future directions in biomarker-driven cardiovascular risk management.",2025,"['low - density lipoprotein cholester', 'ldl - c', 'non - high - density lipoprotein cholester', 'non - hdl - c', 'apolipoprotein b', 'apo b', 'ldl - c', 'non - hdl - c', 'apo b', 'ldl - c', 'non - hdl - c', 'apo b', 'lipoprotein ( a )', 'apo b', 'non - hdl - c', 'ldl - c', 'apo b', 'non - hdl - c']","['apolipoprotein b', 'apo b']"
Functional Complexity of Thermogenic Adipose Tissue: From Thermogenesis to Metabolic and Fibroinflammatory Crosstalk.,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has shifted from being considered a transient thermogenic organ of infancy to a metabolically dynamic and multifunctional tissue throughout life. Histologically and developmentally distinct from white and beige adipocytes, BAT originates from a myogenic lineage and is characterised by a high mitochondrial density, multilocular lipid droplets, and abundant sympathetic innervation. Its defining function, non-shivering thermogenesis, is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and complemented by alternative mechanisms such as futile creatine and calcium cycling. Beyond heat production, thermogenic fat is crucial in regulating whole-body metabolism. It contributes to glucose, lipid, and branched-chain amino acid homeostasis, and engages in endocrine and paracrine signalling through a rich secretome of batokines, lipid mediators, and extracellular vesicle-bound microRNAs. These signals orchestrate crosstalk with the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and immune system, enhancing insulin sensitivity, vascularisation, and anti-inflammatory responses. Brown/Beige fat also exhibits notable anti-fibrotic properties and supports adipose tissue remodelling, maintaining structural and functional plasticity under metabolic stress. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of thermogenic adipose tissue biology, integrating its structural, developmental, and molecular features with its expanding physiological functions, highlighting its pivotal role in energy balance as well as its emerging therapeutic potential in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders.",2025,"['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'insulin']","['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'insulin']"
Pharmacologic Disruption: How Emerging Weight Loss Therapies Are Challenging Bariatric Surgery Guidelines.,"Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease with multifactorial origins and significant global health implications. Historically, bariatric surgery has been the most effective intervention for achieving sustained weight loss and metabolic improvement, especially in individuals with moderate to severe obesity. However, the therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving. Recent advances in pharmacotherapy-including GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual and triple incretin agonists, and amylin-based combination therapies-have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy, with some agents inducing 15-25% weight loss, approaching outcomes once exclusive to surgical intervention. These developments challenge the continued applicability of existing bariatric surgery criteria, which were established in an era of limited medical alternatives. In this narrative review, we examine the evolution of surgical eligibility thresholds and critically assess the potential role of novel pharmacotherapies in redefining treatment algorithms. By comparing the efficacy, safety, metabolic benefits, and cost-effectiveness of surgery versus next-generation drugs, we explore whether a more stepwise, pharmacotherapy-first approach may now be justified, particularly in patients with BMI 30-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. We also discuss future directions in obesity management, including personalized treatment strategies, perioperative drug use, and the integration of pharmacologic agents into long-term care pathways. As the field advances, a paradigm shift toward individualized, minimally invasive interventions appears inevitable-necessitating a timely re-evaluation of current bariatric surgery guidelines to reflect the expanding potential of medical therapy.",2025,"['g', '##lp - 1 receptor', 'incretin', 'am', '##ylin']",['incretin']
Dietary protein governs the role of insulin signaling in the postprandial regulation of hepatic mTORC1,"The nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway controls cellular and organismal growth and metabolism, while aberrant activation is linked to human disease, including metabolic disease. Cellular studies have established several regulatory mechanisms influencing mTORC1 activation, but the physiological signals that control mTORC1 at the organismal and tissue levels are less well defined. mTORC1 is dynamically regulated by fasting and feeding in metabolic tissues, with both nutrients and insulin proposed to activate mTORC1 in response to feeding. Here, a liver-specific mouse model that disconnects mTORC1 activation from AKT-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation is employed. This genetic mouse model demonstrates that AKT-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation is the predominant mechanism of hepatic mTORC1 induction by insulin but is dispensable for activation by feeding. Furthermore, dietary protein is critical and dictates the insulin-responsiveness of hepatic mTORC1 signaling. Contrary to dogma, hepatic mTORC1 signaling was not elevated in response to diet-induced obesity associated with the phenotypes of type-2 diabetes, including hyperinsulinemia, systemic insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, and blocking hepatic AKT-TSC-mTORC1 signaling did not prevent these metabolic impairments. Evidence is also provided supporting a role for glucagon in hepatic mTORC1 suppression during fasting. This study reveals a hierarchy of physiological signals regulating hepatic mTORC1.",2025,"['rapamycin complex 1', 'mtorc1', 'mtorc1', 'mtorc1', 'mtorc1', 'insulin', 'mtorc1', 'mtorc1', 'a', '##kt', 'tsc2', 'akt', 'tsc2', 'hepatic mtorc1', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'hepatic mtorc1', 'hepatic mtorc1', 'insulin', 'akt', 'tsc', 'mtorc1', 'glucagon', 'hepatic mtorc1', 'hepatic mtorc1']","['mtorc1', 'insulin', 'tsc2', 'akt', 'tsc', 'glucagon']"
A Contemporary Rationale for Agonism of the GIP Receptor in the Treatment of Obesity.,"In combatting the obesity crisis, leveraging mechanisms that lower body weight is critical. The finding that treatment with tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, produces profound weight loss highlights the value of activating the incretin receptors. Supporting this, recent studies have revealed mechanisms by which GIP receptor (GIPR) activation is beneficial in pancreatic islets, the central nervous system (CNS), and adipose tissue. Paradoxically, a hypothesis has emerged that GIPR antagonism could be an additional option in treating obesity. This concept stems from concern that GIP facilitates lipid uptake and storage in adipose tissue, although the lipid-buffering capacity of adipocytes versus other cell types is metabolically favorable. In this article, we highlight the natural physiology of the incretins, noting GIP as the primary incretin. In the CNS, GIPR agonism attenuates nausea and suppresses appetite, features that also help GLP-1 receptor agonism promote a negative energy balance. Further, we provide rationale that, in protecting against ectopic fat distribution and augmenting substrate utilization to promote insulin sensitivity, GIPR activity in adipose tissue is advantageous. Collectively, these attributes support GIPR agonism in the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease.",2025,"['glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide', 'gip', 'glucagon - like peptide 1', 'glp - 1 ) receptor', 'incretin receptors', 'gip receptor', 'gipr', 'gipr', 'gip', 'incretins', 'gip', 'incretin', 'gipr', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'gipr', 'gipr']","['gip', 'glucagon like peptide 1', 'gip receptor', 'gipr', 'incretins', 'incretin', 'glp 1 receptor', 'insulin']"
Obesity-cancer axis crosstalk: Molecular insights and therapeutic approaches.,"Now recognized as a global health crisis, obesity has been linked to an increased risk of many types of cancer, including those of the breast, colon, rectum, uterus, gallbladder, and ovary. Obesity and cancer share several characteristics at the cellular, molecular, and epigenetic levels. Obesity is characterized by chronic inflammation of the adipose tissue (AT), resulting in genotoxic stress that further induces metabolic complications and contributes to the initiation and progression of cancer. The excessive accumulation of AT provides adipokines and lipids to engage tumor cells with stromal and immune cells to infiltrate carcinomas and secrete a plethora of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that contribute to carcinogenesis. Obesity also alters the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells, thereby providing a suitable environment for the growth and progression of cancer. Obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation also perturbs the gut microbiome, which produces metabolites that can further increase the risk of cancer progression. This review will discuss links between obesity and cancer progression, including several crucial pathways that bridge the crosstalk between obesity-associated changes in AT inflammation, immune cells, adipokines, chemokines, and tumor cells to support cancer progression. We will also discuss our insights into the mechanisms by which obesity-driven factors influence metabolic reprogramming and touch base on how obesity mediates microbiome dysbiosis to alter metabolite and affect cancer progression. Altogether, this review highlights the crossroads of the obesity-cancer axis, describes its salient features, and presents possible therapeutic approaches for obesity-related cancers.",2025,[],[]
From Lab to Clinic and Farm: Leveraging &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Feeding Studies to Combat Eating Disorders and Pest Challenges.,"<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> has been a cornerstone of biological research, offering critical insights into genetics, neurobiology, and disease modelling. This review examines <i>Drosophila</i> feeding research, including the diverse assays available to study feeding behaviour, and explores its biomedical and entomological applications. We highlight studies that have advanced our understanding of human feeding and eating disorders, vector-borne infectious diseases, and agricultural pest control. In clinical applications, we discuss a two-pronged approach: using <i>Drosophila</i> to model human feeding and eating disorders, as well as to study insect vectors that contribute to human disease transmission. We explore how feeding studies in <i>Drosophila</i> provide valuable insights into energy homeostasis, metabolic regulation, pathogen-host interactions, and vector biology. Beyond clinical relevance, the entomological applications of <i>Drosophila</i> feeding research extend to sustainable pest management and insecticide resistance. Finally, we identify gaps in current research and suggest promising directions for further exploration. By leveraging the genetic and behavioural tools available in this model, researchers can continue to uncover conserved mechanisms with broad implications for human health, disease control, and agricultural sustainability.",2025,[],[]
GLP-1 receptor agonism: a transformative approach for managing type-2 diabetes and obesity.,"GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a breakthrough for managing type-2 diabetes and obesity, offering metabolic benefits across multiple organ systems. These medications provide effective glycaemic control, significant weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection through complex signalling pathways affecting pancreatic, gastrointestinal, neural, and cardiovascular tissues. Their therapeutic potential extends beyond metabolic disorders. Clinical studies demonstrate substantial decreases in HbA1c, body weight (15-20%), and cardiovascular events compared to traditional treatments. Emerging applications include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and neurodegenerative conditions. Significant barriers still exist despite established safety profiles, such as high costs that restrict access worldwide, a lack of predictive biomarkers for treatment response, a lack of knowledge about the mechanistics of gut microbiota interactions, and an incomplete understanding of long-term safety, particularly with regard to thyroid and pancreatic effects. Research gaps include appropriate patient classification, cost-effectiveness across healthcare systems, and established methodologies for developing applications. Potential future developments include novel delivery mechanisms, multi-receptor agonists, and a broader range of therapeutic uses for the treatment of metabolic disorders and their consequences. From their identification as incretin hormones to development of long-acting analogue, GLP-1 agonists have revolutionized metabolic disease management. Their pleiotropic benefits arise from intricate signalling cascades that regulate appetite, insulin secretion, and energy homeostasis across multiple tissues.",2025,"['glp - 1 receptor', 'h', 'glp - 1', 'insulin']","['glp 1 receptor', 'glp 1', 'insulin']"
Regulators of RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C methylation are adipose tissue depot-specific expressed and correlate with clinical variables of obesity in humans.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a global health burden and recent evidence indicates that epitranscriptomic regulation is potentially involved in its etiology. The epitranscriptomic mark 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) is implicated in cancer and recent data linked the gene expression of m<sup>5</sup>C writers, erasers and readers to diabetes, a well-known co-morbidity of obesity. Here, we tested whether gene expression of m<sup>5</sup>C regulators in paired samples of human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue is <b>(i)</b> adipose tissue depot-specific and <b>(ii)</b> correlates with important clinical variables of obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Intra-individually paired adipose tissue samples from human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and omental visceral adipose tissue (OVAT) were utilized from three different cohorts from the Leipzig Obesity Biobank including a large cross-sectional cohort, a two-step bariatric surgery cohort and a cohort of metabolically healthy vs unhealthy individuals (LOBB, total <i>N=</i>962). Data analysis on intra-individual samples was performed by using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while in comparisons on independent groups the unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed. Bonferroni correction method was used to adjust multiple testing of p-values and Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess associations.<h4>Results</h4>We observed that multiple m<sup>5</sup>C regulators were differentially expressed between human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots. Interestingly, we found that for several regulators the effects were less pronounced after weight loss, whilst stronger in individuals with insulin resistance compared to their healthy counterparts. A strong correlation of m<sup>5</sup>C regulator expression with macrophages was observed in OVAT compared to its SAT counterpart. Correlations between m<sup>5</sup>C regulators with important clinical variables related to obesity were observed in all three cohorts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings provide evidence for adipose tissue depot-specific gene expression of m<sup>5</sup>C regulators that correlate with clinical variables of obesity.",2025,"['m < sup > 5 < / su', '> c', 'm < sup > 5 <', 'su', '>', 'insulin', 'm < sup > 5 < / sup > c', 'm < su', '>']",['insulin']
Adcy8 deficiency contributes to impaired lipolysis and an increased prevalence of obesity in mice.,"Obesity is a global chronic disease characterized by an imbalance in energy homeostasis. Dysfunction of adipocytes and adipose tissue are fundamental defects that contribute to the development of obesity. Adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8) serves as a key downstream signaling factor of G protein-coupled receptors, catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is essential for maintaining energy balance. Although ADCY8 is expressed in adipose tissue, its specific role in adipose energy homeostasis remains unclear and warrants further investigation. Our findings demonstrate that compared to individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI), obese individuals exhibit increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation, significantly enlarged adipocytes, reduced ADCY8 expression in VAT, decreased cAMP levels, and diminished phosphorylation of key lipolytic enzymes. In Adcy8 knockout (Adcy8<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, more severe lipid accumulation was observed under both normal and high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, accompanied by reduced activity of the adipose tissue cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. Notably, forskolin enhanced lipolysis and reduced adipocyte size in diet-induced obese wild-type mice, an effect abrogated in Adcy8<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these results indicate that adipose tissue ADCY8 regulates phosphorylation of lipolysis-related proteins via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, thereby influencing adipose tissue lipid accumulation. These findings establish ADCY8 as a novel molecular target and provide a theoretical foundation for obesity therapy.",2025,"['adenylate cyclase 8', 'adcy8', 'g protein - coupled receptors', 'adcy8', 'adcy8', 'adcy8', 'adcy8', 'pka', 'adcy8', 'adcy8', 'pka', 'adcy8']","['adenylate cyclase 8', 'adcy8', 'g protein coupled receptors', 'pka']"
Genetically modeled GLP1R and GIPR agonism reduce binge drinking and alcohol-associated phenotypes: a multi-ancestry drug-target Mendelian randomization study.,"Pharmacological modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) through dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, commonly used for diabetes and obesity, shows promise in reducing alcohol consumption. We applied drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) using genetic variation at these loci to assess their long-term effects on problematic alcohol use (PAU), binge drinking, alcohol misuse classifications, liver health, and other substance use behaviors. Genetic proxies for lowered BMI, modeling the appetite-suppressing and weight-reducing effects of variants in both the GIPR and GLP1R loci (""GIPR/GLP1R""), were linked with reduced binge drinking in the primary (β = -0.44, 95% CI [-0.72, -0.15], P = 2.42 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and replication data (β = -0.13, [-0.22, -0.04], P = 0.0058). HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R variants was associated with reduced risk of heavy drinking with psychiatric comorbidities versus low-risk drinking (odds ratio [OR] = 0.62, [0.45, 0.85], P = 0.0031), with replication in independent HbA1c data (OR = 0.71, [0.60, 0.84], P = 5.22 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and directional consistency with reduced PAU. Analysis of individual loci indicated that both GIPR and GLP1R were protective against heavy drinking, underscoring the importance of both targets. While estimates for other substance use disorders (tobacco, cannabis, opioid) were consistently null, food preference analyses revealed that BMI lowering via GIPR/GLP1R reduced fatty food liking (β = -1.58, [-2.01, -1.14], P = 1.62 × 10<sup>-12</sup>) and increased vegetarian food liking (β = 2.08, [1.17, 2.99], P = 8.22 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), implicating metabolic and appetite regulation pathways for the alcohol consumption findings. For liver health, HbA1c lowering via GIPR/GLP1R was associated with reduced NAFLD (β = -0.34, [-0.50, -0.18], P = 2.74 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and lower ALT levels (β = -0.26, [-0.38, -0.15], P = 8.39 × 10<sup>-6</sup>), with replication supporting these findings. Consistency across multiple MR methods and colocalization analyses strengthened causal inference. Mediation analysis suggested reductions in hazardous alcohol consumption partially explain the cardioprotective effects of these agonists. Multi-ancestry analyses supported directionally aligned relationships in non-European cohorts.

Alternative Splicing Regulation in Metabolic Disorders.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental mechanism for enhancing transcriptome diversity and regulating gene expression, crucial for various cellular processes and the development of complex traits. This review examines the role of AS in metabolic disorders, including obesity, weight loss, dyslipidemias, and metabolic syndrome. We explore the molecular mechanisms underlying AS regulation, focusing on the interplay between cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, and the influence of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Advances in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics have unveiled the extensive landscape of AS events across different tissues and conditions, highlighting the importance of tissue-specific splicing in metabolic regulation. We discuss the impact of genetic variants on AS, with a particular emphasis on splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) and their association with cardiometabolic traits. The review also covers the regulation of spliceosome components by phosphorylation, the role of m6A modification in AS, and the interaction between transcription and splicing. Additionally, we address the clinical relevance of AS, illustrating how splicing misregulation contributes to metabolic diseases and the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting splicing mechanisms.

"Distinct effects of semaglutide and tirzepatide on metabolic and inflammatory gene expression in brown adipose tissue of mice fed a high-fat, high-fructose diet.","<h4>Background</h4>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is crucial for overall energy homeostasis as a thermogenic organ with high metabolic activity. While the recruitment of BAT contributes to improved glycemic and lipid homeostasis, the exact molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood.<h4>Objective</h4>This investigation compared the transcriptomic responses of semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist) on BAT in mice fed a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD). These outcomes enhance our understanding of the metabolic actions of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, providing a conceptual basis for future BAT-targeted therapeutic strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-eight male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON; <i>n</i> = 7, standard diet) or an obesity model group (<i>n</i> = 21, HFHFD). Following the establishment of obesity, the obese mice were further randomized into three intervention groups (<i>n</i> = 7) and administered subcutaneous injections of saline, semaglutide, or tirzepatide for 7 weeks. Metabolic parameters (including body weight, glycemic and lipid profiles, and insulin levels) and BAT morphology were assessed. RNA sequencing of BAT was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was subsequently employed to validate the expression of selected DEGs.<h4>Results</h4>Both semaglutide and tirzepatide reduced body weight, improved lipid profiles, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Compared with the saline group, administration of semaglutide led to differential expression of 467 genes (199 downregulated and 268 upregulated), whereas tirzepatide modulated 40 genes (20 downregulated and 20 upregulated). Bioinformatic analysis identified <i>Cyp1a1</i>, <i>Hsd11b1</i>, <i>Atp1a3</i>, <i>Tfrc</i>, <i>Ptger4</i>, and <i>Il1b</i> as potential therapeutic targets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Semaglutide and tirzepatide may share common targets (<i>Cyp1a1</i>, <i>Hsd11b1</i>, and <i>Atp1a3</i>) that enhance insulin sensitivity, improve metabolism, and promote weight loss. <i>Tfrc</i>, <i>Ptger4</i>, and <i>Il1b</i> may also serve as tirzepatide-specific targets, potentially elucidating its enhanced anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory effects.",2025,"['g', '##lp - 1 receptor', 'gip / glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1', 'gip', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'kyoto encyclopedia', 'k', 'insulin', 'cyp1a1', 'hsd11b1', 'at', '##p1a3', 'tfrc', 'ptger4', 'il1b', 'cyp1a1', 'hsd11b1', 'at', '##p1a3', 'insulin', 'tfrc', 'ptger4', 'il1b']","['glp 1', 'gip', 'glp 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'cyp1a1', 'hsd11b1', 'tfrc', 'ptger4', 'il1b']"
Beyond Traditional Risk Factors: Integrating Epicardial Adipose Tissue into the Comorbidity Landscape of HFpEF.,"Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat layer next to the myocardium, has become an important focus in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). When enlarged and inflamed, EAT increases pericardial restraint, releases fibroinflammatory mediators, and disrupts myocardial energetics, thereby reproducing the high-pressure, exercise-intolerant HFpEF phenotype regardless of body mass index. Modern echocardiography, cardiac CT, and MRI, enhanced by artificial intelligence texture analytics, now enable precise depot-specific quantification, making EAT a measurable therapeutic target. Early interventional studies suggest that caloric restriction, bariatric surgery, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, statins, PCSK9 antibodies, and colchicine can reduce EAT volume or alter its inflammatory profile, with concurrent improvements in haemodynamics and biomarkers. However, definitive outcome trials are still pending.

"Within-person, prospective relations between sleep duration and efficiency and next-day physical activity among behavioral weight loss participants.","<h4>Objective</h4>Behavioral weight loss programs (BWL) prescribe moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) to promote weight control and overall health. However, adherence to the MVPA prescription is low. One factor that may be associated with poor MVPA adherence, both theoretically and as demonstrated by between-subject studies, is suboptimal sleep. Nevertheless, no study to date has examined the within-subject relations between sleep and MVPA among BWL participants, which could better account for between-subject third variables that may confound the relation between sleep and MVPA (e.g., socioeconomic status). This secondary analysis is the first to investigate the within-subject, prospective relations between sleep duration (controlling for time in bed) and sleep quality (operationalized as sleep efficiency, approximately minutes asleep divided by time in bed) with next-day MVPA among BWL participants.<h4>Method</h4>Participants (N = 104) were adults with overweight/obesity engaging in a year-long BWL program. Sleep variables and MVPA bouts were measured using accelerometers at mid-treatment. Predictor variables were standardized, and analyses were conducted using multilevel models, controlling for weekday/weekend status, condition, gender, and body mass index (BMI).<h4>Results</h4>Results indicated within-subject sleep duration (b = 15.48, SE = 6.30, p =.014), but not sleep efficiency (b = 2.16, SE = 1.22, p =.08), was positively associated with next-day minutes of MVPA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Findings may support modifications of BWL programs to include sleep hygiene education or strategies from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia to target sleep duration, which in turn may improve MVPA engagement.",2025,[],[]
Linking Metabolic Disorders and Immune System Phenomena in Schizophrenia: The Role of Adipose Tissue and Inflammation.,"Emerging evidence highlights the role of chronic low-grade inflammation and dysregulated cytokines in both obesity and schizophrenia, suggesting overlapping immune system pathways that contribute to cognition and nervous system inflammation. Excess adipose tissue functions as an active endocrine organ, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators that may serve as potential biomarkers, while the use of antipsychotic agents in schizophrenia further modifies cytokine profiles and immune responses. A key knowledge gap lies in understanding how adipose-related inflammation modifies the severity of psychotic symptoms, cognitive deficits, and the efficacy of antipsychotic medications. This review aims to present excess adipose tissue as a potential contributor to the development of SCZ or a modifier of treatment efficacy, emphasizing the role of immune imbalance, inflammatory pathways, and metabolic dysfunction. By synthesizing current findings, we aim to present obesity not only as a frequent comorbidity in schizophrenia but also as a potential driver of neuroinflammation and disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that excess adiposity may perpetuate a vicious cycle linking metabolic dysfunction, immune activation, and psychiatric symptomatology. Situating these findings within a broader context, the review underscores the clinical need for inflammation-informed, individualized management strategies that integrate psychiatric care with metabolic monitoring. Ultimately, clarifying the shared inflammatory pathways of obesity and schizophrenia may open new avenues for biomarker development and targeted interventions.",2025,[],[]
Advancements and challenges in the management of obesity using pharmacotherapy (Review).,"Obesity is a chronic, recurrent and progressive disease that is a major public health issue, contributing to disability, morbidity and mortality worldwide. The global increase in obesity prevalence has been accompanied by an increase in weight-related comorbidity and mortality rates. To address this growing public health issue, the development and use of anti-obesity medications (AOMs) have escalated in recent years. The present review aims to discuss the most recent information on AOMs and the health effects of their regular use. The gastrointestinal (GI)-hypothalamic axis has been revealed to play a key role in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, which has led to the development of AOMs to target peptides secreted from the GI tract, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 receptor agonists are among the most widely investigated drugs in the rapidly developing field of hormone-based AOMs. However, most GLP-based drugs cause undesirable side effects. A promising approach to combat cardiometabolic conditions, including diabetes and obesity, is to reduce food consumption while also raising energy expenditure. Notably, novel candidate anti-obesity drugs have been shown to activate neurokinin 2 receptors (NK2Rs) in mice, leading to appetite suppression without the side effects observed with previous generations of treatments. However, additional research is necessary to address the side effects associated with AOMs, particularly those affecting the GI tract, gallbladder and pancreas. Furthermore, the potential of NK2R activation merits investigation in clinical trials, particularly in high-risk patients.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'neurokinin 2 receptors', 'nk2rs', 'nk2r']","['glucagon like peptide 1', 'glp 1', 'glp 1 receptor', 'neurokinin 2 receptor', 'nk2r']"
Immune cell-adipose tissue crosstalk in metabolic diseases with a focus on type 1 diabetes.,"Adipose tissue, once regarded merely as an energy reservoir, has emerged as a critical regulator of both metabolic and immune processes. This paradigm shift has profound implications for understanding and managing type 1 diabetes, a condition typically associated with lean individuals. The growing global prevalence of obesity has introduced an underexplored dimension to type 1 diabetes pathophysiology, a phenomenon that has significant consequences for disease development, progression and management. The coexistence of obesity and type 1 diabetes presents unique challenges, including exacerbation of insulin resistance and an elevated risk of complications such as CVD. Obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation, or 'meta-inflammation', creates a proinflammatory environment within adipose tissue. This disrupts systemic immune regulation, promotes insulin resistance and may even potentiate autoimmunity directed to pancreatic beta cells. Addressing these interactions will allow us to reframe research priorities and the management of type 1 diabetes in individuals who also live with obesity. In this review, we explore how adipose tissue maladaptation in obesity influences the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes. We discuss existing literature and gaps in knowledge, and emphasise the importance of addressing these gaps. We also highlight the potential of emerging technologies and precision medicine to tackle the dual challenge of obesity and type 1 diabetes. Advances such as continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems and insights from genomics and metabolomics are revolutionising diabetes care. These tools can enhance glucose management and provide opportunities to mitigate weight-related complications and personalise treatment strategies.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Personalized Nutrition in the Era of Digital Health: A New Frontier for Managing Diabetes and Obesity.,"The integration of digital health technologies with personalized nutrition offers a transformative approach for managing diabetes and obesity. This emerging paradigm extends beyond generic dietary recommendations by tailoring interventions based on genetic, epigenetic, microbiome, and real-time metabolic data. Tools such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), artificial intelligence (AI)-driven meal planning, and mobile health applications enable dynamic dietary adjustments and improved disease monitoring. Data privacy, cost disparities, and the need for robust clinical validation are challenges that remain to be overcome, even if there is a potential benefit. This review examines the synergy between digital health technologies and precision medicine by elucidating the potential of personalized nutrition in chronic disease management. Our literature review demonstrates that tailored diet programs can enhance metabolic well-being and overcome theoretical and practical challenges to their widespread implementation.",2025,[],[]
Focus on Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Target: Drugs Approved or Designed to Treat Obesity.,"Obesity is closely related to metabolic diseases, which brings a heavy burden to the health care system. It is urgent to formulate and implement effective treatment strategies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a protein with seven transmembrane domains connected by type B and G proteins, which is widely distributed and expressed in many organs and tissues. GLP-1 analogues can reduce weight, lower blood pressure, and improve blood lipids. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other diseases have caused scientists' research and development boom. Among them, GLP-1R agonist drugs have developed rapidly in weight-loss drugs. In this paper, based on the target of GLP-1, the mechanism of action of GLP-1 in obesity treatment was deeply studied, and the drugs approved and designed for obesity treatment based on GLP-1 target were elaborated in detail. Innovatively put forward and summarized the double and triple GLP-1 targeted drugs in the treatment of obesity with better effects and less toxic and side effects, and this can make full use of multi-target methods to treat other diseases in the future. Finally, it is pointed out that intestinal flora and microorganisms have many benefits in the treatment of obesity, and fecal bacteria transplantation may be a potential treatment for obesity with less harm to the body.

Low isavuconazole trough levels in critically ill patients with and without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,"Data on isavuconazole exposure in critically ill patients and particularly during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are scarce, and therapeutic drug monitoring is not routinely performed. Critically ill patients admitted to a tertiary ECMO referral center from October 2017 to August 2024 with documented isavuconazole trough levels were retrospectively analyzed. First, measured isavuconazole trough blood levels and the occurrence of dose adjustments were analyzed in patients with and without ECMO support. Fifty-three adult patients were included, of whom 11 (21%) patients were on ECMO support at the first isavuconazole trough level measurement. Median isavuconazole trough level was overall 1.4 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.9-2.5) mg/L and did not differ between ECMO (1.3 [IQR 0.9-1.5] mg/L) and non-ECMO patients (1.6 [IQR 0.9-2.8] mg/L, <i>P</i> = 0.423). During the entire intensive care unit stay, individual doses were increased in 12 (23%) patients, of whom 5 were on ECMO support, whereas dosage was reduced or interrupted in 2 (4%) patients (both without ECMO support). Dose adjustments occurred irregularly and inconsistently after therapeutic drug monitoring, i.e., only in 6 (11%) patients after the initial therapeutic drug monitoring despite 37 (70%) drug levels being outside the target range of 2-4 mg/L. In conclusion, below targeted isavuconazole trough levels were common in critically ill patients investigated, but ECMO did not seem to have an additional negative influence. Dose adjustments appeared more frequently than previously reported, albeit irregularly performed. Regular therapeutic drug monitoring and protocolized dose adjustments should be investigated in future studies.",2025,[],[]
Gut-lung axis in asthma and obesity: role of the gut microbiome.,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease whose severity is exacerbated by obesity. Despite its clinical importance, targeted therapies for asthma in obese patients remain limited. Recent evidence highlights the gut microbiome as a crucial factor linking metabolic and immune pathways involved in both asthma and obesity. This review explores the complex interplay between the gut microbiome, immune responses, and the gut-lung axis, emphasizing how microbial composition, diversity, and metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), influence airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airway inflammation. Obesity alters the gut microbiome, contributing to systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, asthma phenotypes related to obesity are associated with specific gut microbial profiles, suggesting a causal relationship. Animal studies have demonstrated that manipulation of the gut microbiome through diet, antibiotics, or microbial transplantation can alter asthma outcomes, particularly in obesity models. Given these findings, targeting the gut microbiome might be a promising therapeutic strategy for asthma in obese individuals. Potential interventions include probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics, all of which have shown varying degrees of effectiveness in modulating airway inflammation and reducing asthma severity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current knowledge and proposes future directions for microbiome-targeted therapies in managing severe asthma associated with obesity.",2025,[],[]
"Insulin resistance as a mediator of the association between obesity, high-intensity binge drinking, and liver enzyme abnormalities in young and middle-aged adults: a cross-sectional study.","<h4>Background</h4>Binge drinking (BD) and obesity are well-established risk factors for liver enzyme abnormalities, but how varying intensities of BD interact with obesity to affect liver function remains unclear. This study aims to examine whether insulin resistance (IR) mediates the associations between different levels of BD, obesity, their interaction, and liver enzyme abnormalities.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study included 137,878 young and middle-aged adults who underwent physical examinations in southern China between August 2017 and March 2024. BD was self-reported, and IR was assessed using the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index. Causal mediation analysis within the counterfactual framework was used to quantify the mediating role of the TyG index in the associations involving BD intensity, obesity, their interaction, and liver enzyme abnormalities.<h4>Results</h4>The interaction between obesity and high-intensity binge drinking (HIBD) was significantly associated with liver enzyme abnormalities (OR, 1.591; 95% CI, 1.401-1.806). IR, measured by the TyG index, statistically accounted for 36.6% (OR, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.029-1.039) of this association, exceeding the proportion explained in the HIBD alone (25.9%) or obesity alone (16.7%) pathways. No significant mediating effect of IR was observed for non-BD or low-intensity BD, regardless of obesity status.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The TyG index serves as a critical mediator in the synergistic effects of HIBD and obesity on liver enzyme abnormalities. Targeting IR and reducing the intensity of alcohol consumption may help mitigate liver injury in young and middle-aged adults with obesity.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Mixed-Chirality Prohibitin Peptide: D-(RLARLAR)2 Enhances Stability and &lt;i&gt;In Vivo&lt;/i&gt; Effects on Obesity.,"Obesity stands as a global epidemic and is the primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes, ranking as the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. While lifestyle changes can address body fat accumulation, pharmacotherapies can also assist in sustained weight loss. Here, we report the design of a new generation of prohibitin peptide-based therapeutics engineered to target white adipose tissues. These peptides demonstrate significant reduction of body weight in a high-fat diet-induced obesity mouse model and represent a paradigm shift in approaches to the treatment of obesity by inducing mitochondrial uncoupling. The most potent compound, PTP-r, was prohibitin-TP01 substituted with d-arginine. Overall, the study reveals the promising development of next-generation adipose-targeting prohibitin peptides, capable of curbing adipocyte expansion and body weight, with favorable preclinical safety profiles. These peptides hold immense potential for developing new treatments to address obesity and metabolic syndrome.",2025,"['prohibitin p', 'p', '##p - r', 'prohibitin - tp', 'prohibitin']",[]
Optimizing treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in cerebral small vessel disease using genetics.,"Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) causes lacunar stroke (LS) and intracerebral haemorrhage and is the most common pathology underlying vascular dementia. However, there are few trials examining whether treatment of conventional cardiovascular risk factors reduces stroke risk in cSVD, as opposed to stroke as a whole. We used Mendelian randomization techniques to investigate which risk factors are causally related to cSVD and to evaluate whether specific drugs might be beneficial in cSVD prevention. We identified genetic proxies for blood pressure traits, lipids, glycaemic markers, anthropometry measures, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity from large-scale genome-wide association studies of European ancestry. We also selected genetic variants as proxies for drug target perturbation in hypertension, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and obesity. Mendelian randomization was performed to assess their associations with LS from the GIGASTROKE Consortium (n = 6811) and in a sensitivity analysis in a cohort of patients with MRI-confirmed LS (n = 3306). We also investigated associations with three neuroimaging features of cSVD, namely, white matter hyperintensities (n = 55 291), fractional anisotropy (n = 36 460) and mean diffusivity (n = 36 012). Genetic predisposition to higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure was associated with LS and cSVD imaging markers. Genetically predicted liability to diabetes, obesity, smoking, higher triglyceride levels and the ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein also showed detrimental associations with LS risk, whereas genetic predisposition to higher high-density lipoprotein concentrations and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity showed protective associations. Genetically proxied blood pressure lowering through calcium channel blockers was associated with cSVD imaging markers, whereas genetically proxied high-density lipoprotein raising through cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, triglyceride lowering through lipoprotein lipase and weight lowering through gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor were associated with lower risk of LS. Our findings highlight the importance of some conventional cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure and body mass index, in cSVD, but not others, e.g. low-density lipoprotein. The findings also demonstrate the potential beneficial effects of calcium channel blockers on cSVD imaging markers and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, lipoprotein lipase enhancement and gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor obesity-targeted drugs on LS. They provide useful information for initiating future clinical trials examining secondary prevention strategies in cSVD.",2025,"['high - density lipoprotein', 'high - density lipoprotein', 'high - density lipoprotein', 'cholesteryl ester transfer protein', 'lipoprotein lipase', 'gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor', 'low - density lipoprotein', 'cholesteryl ester transfer protein', 'lipoprotein lipase', 'gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor']","['high density lipoprotein', 'cholesteryl ester transfer protein', 'lipoprotein lipase', 'gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor', 'low density lipoprotein']"

The Dual Role of Conjugated Linoleic Acid in Obesity and Metabolic Disorders.,"Conjugated Linoleic Acid (cis-9, trans-11, CLA)/(trans-10, cis-12, CLA) has been extensively studied for its role in obesity control and metabolic diseases. This review explores the molecular characteristics of CLA, its metabolic pathways, and its inconsistent effects on lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, energy expenditure, and inflammation. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that CLA may promote fat oxidation and modulate adipocyte function; however, inconsistent findings highlight dose-dependent outcomes and individual variability in response. The dual nature of CLA, showing both beneficial and adverse effects, raises questions about its long-term safety and efficacy. This review critically examines CLA's molecular role in obesity and metabolic regulation, providing insights into its therapeutic promise and limitations. Future research should focus on personalized approaches to CLA supplementation, considering genetic and lifestyle factors for tailored nutritional guidance.",2025,[],[]

"The Pivotal Role of the Western Diet, Hyperinsulinemia, Ectopic Fat, and Diacylglycerol-Mediated Insulin Resistance in Type 2 Diabetes.","Genetic background, the ""Western diet"", and environment may all contribute to hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia can precede and cause insulin resistance. In situations of fuel overload, insulin resistance limits the amount fuel (glucose and fatty acids) entering insulin-sensitive tissues. When energy intake is chronically greater than energy expenditure, the capacity of the subcutaneous fat tissues to store fat can be overpowered. If subcutaneous fat tissues are no longer able to accommodate excess energy, there will be spillover of lipids. Excess calories will be stored as ectopic fat (triglycerides) in the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. Growing evidence suggests that ectopic fat deposition directly causes insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Overnutrition and ectopic fat increase diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation in fat cells, hepatocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. A unifying hypothesis proposes that translocated DAG into the plasma membrane induces insulin resistance in all these three cell types. In addition, ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas induces beta-cell dysfunction. Introducing a negative energy balance by bariatric surgery or a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) reduces ectopic fat depositions from the liver and pancreas and decreases intracellular DAG content: both are effective treatments to restore insulin sensitivity, normalize metabolism, and put type 2 diabetes in remission.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Disentangling consequences of self-perceived weight from excess adiposity in metabolically healthy overweight/obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Greater self-perceived weight is detrimental to cardiometabolic health among people with overweight/obesity. However, it is impractical to test and unknown whether weight-related psychosocial factors, like self-perceived weight, independently affect cardiometabolic health apart from physiological dysregulation produced by excess adiposity among people with overweight/obesity. Metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHOv/Ob) involves overweight/obesity, but with the absence of metabolic dysfunction. The MHOv/Ob phenotype may be a promising model to examine unique contributions of self-perceived weight to long-term changes in metabolic health. We tested whether self-perceived weight independently contributes to declining metabolic health by comparing people with MHOv/Ob and metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW). We hypothesized that: (1) those with MHOv/Ob are more likely to become metabolically unhealthy and gain BMI at follow-up (7-11 years later) compared to MHNW, and (2) these transitions in metabolic health and BMI among those with MHOv/Ob will be mediated by higher self-perceived weight.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we classified metabolically healthy participants by weight status (normal weight, overweight, obesity) at Wave IV (ages 25-33). We tested whether longitudinal transitions from a metabolically healthy to unhealthy state (n = 788) and changes in BMI (n = 901) among MHOv/Ob (vs. MHNW) participants were mediated by higher self-perceived weight at Wave V (ages 33-43).<h4>Results</h4>The MHOv/Ob (vs. MHNW) groups had greater odds of becoming metabolically unhealthy at Wave V (overweight odds ratio [OR]: 3.85 [1.87, 7.94], obesity OR: 9.12 [5.01, 16.61]). However, those with metabolically healthy obesity exhibited decreasing BMI (β: - 0.98 [- 1.75, - 020]). Although self-perceived weight was higher among the MHOv/Ob group, it did not mediate the relationship between Wave IV weight status and Wave V metabolic health (indirect effects-overweight risk difference (RD): 0.0046 [- 0.025, 0.033]; obesity RD: 0.0095 [- 0.050, 0.071]) or change in BMI (indirect effects-overweight β: - 0.30 [- 2.38, 1.75]; obesity β: - 0.51 [- 4.02, 2.84]).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Self-perceived weight alone may not contribute to long-term metabolic dysfunction over-and-above physiological strain of excess adiposity among those living with overweight/obesity. However, future research on determinants of MHOv/Ob phenotypes should examine the role of other weight-related psychosocial factors such as weight stigma.",2025,[],[]
Biopsychosocial Determinants and Comorbid Risks of Obesity Among University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Obesity among university students is a growing concern, often influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. Few studies in Saudi Arabia have addressed this issue using a comprehensive framework. This study aims to examine the prevalence of obesity and its biopsychosocial predictors among university students, as well as their perceptions, behaviors, and comorbidities. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted at Jazan University during the 2024-2025 academic year. A total of 819 undergraduate students completed a structured, self-administered Arabic questionnaire. The tool assessed sociodemographic variables, body mass index (BMI) (calculated from self-reported height and weight), biological and psychological factors, social influences, lifestyle behaviors, and comorbidities. Bivariate associations were tested using chi-square analyses, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of obesity. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of obesity was 19.6%, and 22.6% of students were overweight. Obesity was significantly more prevalent among males (26.7%) than females (9.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and among students aged 24 years and above (24.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.024). Independent predictors of obesity included being overweight in childhood (AOR = 5.23, 95% CI: 3.47-7.90), belief in a genetic predisposition (AOR = 4.66), emotional eating (AOR = 2.57), academic or personal stress (AOR = 5.36), and social pressures related to body image (AOR = 2.96). Comorbidities significantly associated with obesity included high cholesterol (AOR = 5.40), sleep disorders (AOR = 2.99), and joint pain (AOR = 1.96). More than 80% of students with obesity reported current or past weight loss attempts, and nearly 60% received medical advice to lose weight. <b>Conclusions:</b> Obesity among Jazan University students is significantly associated with male gender, early-life weight history, emotional and academic stress, and social pressures. Students with obesity also experience a higher burden of comorbid conditions, even at a young age. These findings highlight the need for integrated, student-centered interventions that address both the psychological and social dimensions of weight management in university settings.",2025,[],[]
The Role of miR-802 in Diabetic Kidney Disease: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Insights.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. Despite its rising incidence, awareness and early detection of renal complications remain limited. Current research in DKD aims to identify non-invasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and to develop effective therapies that go beyond controlling risk factors, as few options are available to halt or reverse kidney inflammation and fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), key regulators of gene expression, have emerged as promising candidates for both diagnosis and treatment in DKD. Among them, miR-802 has gained attention due to its role in modulating inflammatory, fibrotic, and metabolic pathways. Elevated levels of miR-802 correlate with renal inflammation and fibrosis in diabetic and obese models, highlighting its potential as both a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. This review focuses on the emerging evidence supporting the involvement of miR-802 in the pathogenesis of DKD and its potential role as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. In addition, considering that miR-802 has also been implicated in other diseases, such as cancer, where it may act either as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, these contrasting effects will also be discussed as part of the broader context to better understand the multifaceted biological roles of miR-802. This review emphasizes the need for further research to clarify the molecular mechanisms of miR-802 and to assess its potential for clinical translation in DKD.",2025,"['mir - 802', 'mir - 802', 'mir - 802', 'mir - 802', 'mir - 802', 'mir - 802']",[]
A review: Mechanism and research progress of the effects of Astragalus polysaccharides on obesity.,"As living standards rise, health has become a top concern, and the issue of obesity has drawn extensive attention. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), the key active component of Astragalus, have emerged as a promising subject in weight-loss research. Recent breakthroughs in APS studies-such as its dual regulatory effects on gut microbiota and metabolic pathways, novel insights into its anti-inflammatory mechanisms via TLR4/NF-κB signaling, and synergistic interactions with other herbal compounds-warrant an updated synthesis of current knowledge. Previous reviews on APS and obesity have predominantly focused on isolated mechanisms (e.g., lipid metabolism or inflammation), yet a comprehensive analysis integrating its multi-target effects, comparative advantages over conventional anti-obesity drugs, and clinical translation challenges remains lacking. This review uniquely consolidates advances in APS research over the past five years, emphasizing its holistic action on inflammation, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and gut dysbiosis. By systematically comparing APS with pharmacological and nutritional interventions, we highlight its potential as a natural, low-toxicity alternative with multi-organ regulatory capabilities.

Vital Role of Visceral Adipose Tissue in Maintaining Cognitive Functions.,"The aging process involves a decline in certain cognitive abilities. Cognitive aging progresses more quickly with obesity and more slowly with exercise and fasting. All of these conditions have strong impacts on white adipose tissue, which suggests that this tissue may play a pivotal role in the progression of cognitive aging. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin indispensable for maintaining brain functions, becomes insufficient with age. Obesity also decreases the BDNF level in the hippocampus. This deficiency not only results in cognitive impairment but increases susceptibility to obesity. Both exercise and fasting increase the BDNF level in the hippocampus. Our study demonstrates that the chemokine ligand CX3CL1 in white adipose tissue is involved in the regulation of the BDNF level in the hippocampus. Aging reduces CX3CL1 expression, interfering with the mechanisms. Other studies have suggested that obesity increases adipose CX3CL1 expression; however, CX3CL1 augmented under obese condition may not contribute to the promotion of the BDNF level in the hippocampus. This suggests that the malfunction of the adipose CX3CL1-mediated mechanism could be involved in the downregulation of the hippocampus BDNF level under obese conditions. Studies have also suggested that the adipose CX3CL1-mediated mechanism appears to be involved in the exercise-induced promotion of BDNF expression in the hippocampus. Its involvement in the fasting-induced BDNF promotion is still unknown. Therefore, aging, obesity, and exercise appear to affect white adipose tissue to regulate the hippocampus BDNF level. While further studies are required to elucidate the precise role of the adipose CX3CL1-mediated regulation of BDNF expression, studies on white adipose tissue may provide new therapeutic targets for preventing age-associated cognitive decline.",2025,"['brain - derived neurotrophic factor', 'bdnf', 'bdnf', 'bdnf', 'cx3cl1', 'bdnf', 'cx3cl1', 'adipose cx3cl1', 'cx3cl1', 'bdnf', 'adipose cx3cl1', 'bdnf', 'adipose', 'cx3cl1', 'bdnf', 'bdnf', 'bdnf', 'adipose cx3cl1', 'bdnf']","['brain derived neurotrophic factor', 'bdnf', 'cx3cl1']"

"Is metabolically healthy obesity shaped by inflammation, gender differences, and fat distribution?","The obesity epidemic continues to challenge global cardiovascular (CV) health, but not all obesity is equal. Emerging evidence underscores that distinct obesity phenotypes-particularly metabolically healthy <i>vs</i> unhealthy profiles-confer differential CV risks. Recent large-scale studies have revealed that even metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) is associated with an increased risk of adverse CV events, particularly in the context of socioeconomic disadvantage. Central is the role of chronic low-grade inflammation, termed ""metaflammation"", which can persist even in the absence of overt metabolic syndrome and is shaped by both gender and fat distribution. Epicardial and visceral adiposity contribute to this pro-inflammatory state and are strongly associated with conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Notably, aging and hormonal changes, particularly in women, may destabilize MHO status, increasing CV vulnerability over time. This overview calls for a paradigm shift in cardiometabolic care, moving beyond anthropometric parameters toward a more refined assessment that incorporate inflammatory biomarkers, fat distribution and sex-specific factors. Recognizing these underlying biological and phenotypic differences enables more accurate CV risk stratification and supports the development of precision-based therapeutic strategies. Ultimately, understanding not just who is at risk, but why, is essential to improving prevention and outcomes across diverse populations facing the burden of obesity.",2025,[],[]
Association of Gestational Weight Gain with Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Individuals with Obesity.,"This study aimed to determine optimal gestational weight gain (GWG) considering adverse infant and maternal outcomes among individuals with obesity, with detailed classification for body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher.This study was a population-based retrospective cohort study, using U.S. birth certificate data from 2017 to 2021. We included nulliparous individuals with singleton pregnancies delivering live births between 37<sup>0/7</sup> and 41<sup>6/7</sup> weeks' gestation, excluding those with pregestational diabetes or hypertension, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, major fetal anomalies, or chromosomal disorders. The study focused on three main outcomes: primary cesarean delivery, small for gestational age (SGA), and large for gestational age (LGA). GWG was evaluated in 2-kg increments, from weight loss >8 kg to gains ≥28 kg. Prepregnancy BMI was stratified into four categories: BMI of 30 to <35, 35 to <40, 40 to <50, and ≥50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Odds ratios and absolute risk reduction were used to identify GWG ranges with balanced risks for three outcomes within each BMI category.Among 1,677,968 individuals with obesity, increased GWG was associated with higher absolute risks of cesarean delivery and LGA and lower risk of SGA across all BMI categories. Optimal GWG ranges varied by prepregnancy BMI: >12 to ≤14 kg for BMI of 30 to <35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; >10 to ≤12 kg for BMI of 35 to <40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; >6 to ≤10 kg for BMI of 40 to <50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; >0 to ≤8 kg for BMI of 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher.We identified higher upper and lower GWG limits for individuals with BMI of 30 to 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and lower limits for those with BMI ≥50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, compared with the guidelines recommended by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine. These findings suggest the need to tailor GWG recommendations based on the severity of obesity. · Optimal GWG varies by obesity class, requiring tailored guidelines.. · Those with BMI ≥50 kg/m may need lower target for gestational gain than current recommendation.. · The optimal GWG range could be changed based on the outcomes of interest..",2025,"['g', 'g']",[]
"Puerarin as a multi-targeted modulator of lipid metabolism: molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential and prospects for nutritional translation.","Lipid metabolism is a dynamic and intricate process involving the uptake, synthesis, storage and catabolism of lipid compounds in the body. Its homeostasis is crucial for maintaining the health of the organism. The regulatory network of lipid metabolism homeostasis consists of several key molecules, including SREBPs, PPARs, ChREBP, FXR, LXR, AMPK, and ncRNAs. Puerarin (Pue), an isoflavone derivative, has been demonstrated to enhance lipid metabolism by modulating the aforementioned signaling cascades. Pue has found extensive application in the pharmaceutical, food, and nutraceutical industries. Considering the multi-target and multi-pathway pharmacological properties of Pue, the present study focuses on the molecular mechanism of Pue in the regulation of lipid metabolism, the spectrum of metabolic diseases, as well as the limitations of the current study and the prospect of nutritional translation. It is hoped that this study will provide a reference for the regulation of lipid homeostasis and remodeling of lipid metabolism, with the aim of optimizing clinical use and product development.",2025,"['srebps', 'ppars', 'chrebp', 'fxr', 'lxr', 'ampk', 'puerarin', 'pue', 'pue', 'pue', 'pue']","['ppar', 'chrebp', 'fxr', 'ampk', 'puerarin']"
"The impact of obesity and weight loss treatment on metabolic parameters, cardiovascular autonomic and sensory nerve function and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; fertilization outcomes in infertile women: a pilot study.","<h4>Introduction</h4>The global rise in obesity is linked to metabolic disorders, such as neuropathy and infertility. Our study aimed to analyze the effects of preconceptional weight loss in infertile women with obesity on peripheral sensory and cardiovascular autonomic nerve function, metabolic parameters, and the success of <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF).<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective cohort study included women with obesity and infertility undergoing weight optimization before IVF, alongside age-matched controls. Clinical and laboratory parameters, cardiovascular autonomic and peripheral sensory function, and body composition were evaluated before and following weight loss therapy.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with obesity [n=58; mean ± SD; age: 33.1 ± 5.42 years; body mass index (BMI): 39.3 ± 6.90 kg/m<sup>2</sup>] had higher resting blood pressure, prevalence of metabolic disorders, and medication usage than controls (n=45; age: 32.1 ± 7.67 years; BMI: 21.1 ± 2.02 kg/m²). Laboratory findings indicated differences in blood cell counts, glucose metabolism markers, kidney and liver functions, and lipid profile between the groups. Cardiovascular autonomic function tests indicated impairment in Valsalva-ratio (1.4 ± 0.22 vs. 1.5 ± 0.23, p<0.001) and 30/15 ratio (1.07 ± 0.12 vs. 1.12 ± 0.13, p<0.05) in patients with obesity. Peripheral sensory function tests revealed significant deterioration in vibration sense and the current perception threshold of the median nerve at 2000 Hz in patients with obesity, as compared to controls. Before and following weight loss therapy no statistically significant difference was found on cardiovascular autonomic and peripheral sensory function. Following weight loss therapy with lifestyle/dietary intervention and liraglutide, 16 female patients with obesity attended the follow-up measurement. They achieved significant weight reduction (104.3 ± 16.64 vs. 89.1 ± 15.74 kg; p<0.05) and 8 became pregnant (5 via IVF, 3 spontaneously).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Peripheral sensory neuronal impairments were detected in infertile women with obesity compared to the controls with normal BMI. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was revealed by 30/15 and Valsalva-ratio in patients with obesity, suggesting the presence of parasympathetic dysfunction. Preconceptional weight loss improved metabolic parameters. Of the infertile female patients with obesity who reached their preconceptional target weight, 18.75% achieved spontaneous pregnancy without IVF, and 62.5% of those who underwent IVF successfully conceived.",2025,[],[]

"Gut microbiota profile in adults with abdominal obesity and non-abdominal obesity: links to body composition and macronutrient intake in Semarang, Indonesia-a brief research report.","<h4>Background</h4>Abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases, with increasing evidence highlighting the role of gut microbiota in its development. In Indonesia, where 23.4% of adults are obese, few studies have examined the gut microbiota in relation to abdominal obesity, particularly in the context of unique dietary patterns. This pilot study investigated the gut microbiota composition in adults with abdominal obesity in Semarang, Indonesia, and its associations with body composition and macronutrient intake.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study was conducted in Semarang and included 46 adults aged 20-50 years, categorized by abdominal obesity status (22 with abdominal obesity and 24 without). Anthropometric measurements, body composition, and dietary intake were assessed. Gut microbiota profiles were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples.<h4>Findings</h4>In the Semarang population, individuals with abdominal obesity had higher visceral fat (12.32 ± 3.44% vs. 6.96 ± 2.91%) compared to those without abdominal obesity. <i>Prevotella_9 copri</i> was positively associated with visceral fat (r = 0.206, <i>p</i> = 0.169), a finding that differs from studies conducted outside Indonesia, potentially showing the uniqueness of the profile.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The correlation of <i>Prevotella_9 copri</i> in subjects from Semarang, Indonesia, differs from findings in other studies, providing a potential unique gut microbiota profile in the Indonesian population and providing a platform for future studies to clarify these hypotheses. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to validate these findings and establish causality.",2025,"['16', 'prevotella _ 9 cop', 'prevotella _ 9 cop']",[]

Development and implementation of childhood obesity module for medical undergraduate using ADDIE model: A mixed method design.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity among children has surged to epidemic levels, with a significant portion of India's population affected by morbid obesity in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. A concise module for primary care physicians to manage a case of childhood obesity in the Indian scenario as a physician of first contact at the community level is unavailable. The use of the ADDIE model for creating modules in medical education is not widespread in India and is relatively uncommon globally. Using the ADDIE model to develop a module in the pediatrics curriculum is relatively uncommon. The primary objective was to develop and implement a childhood obesity module for 3<sup>rd</sup> prof part II MBBS students. The secondary objective was to evaluate the module's outcome.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The study was conducted in the Department of Pediatrics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Deoghar, an institute of national importance (INI) in India. The ADDIE instructional design model was used for creating the structured childhood obesity module. Utilizing Kirkpatrick's framework for backward evaluation, we analyzed the module's effectiveness by considering students' feedback (Level 1) and their end-of-course scores (Level 2) in both cognitive and psychomotor domains.<h4>Results</h4>The childhood obesity module was developed, and it was well received by students. The students found that the module could assist them in managing obese children in real-life situations and were highly satisfied with the module. There was a significant improvement in the mean scores of the MCQ and OSCE tests with effect sizes 4.7 (4.37-5.03) and 2.6 (2.29-2.91), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ADDIE model is highly effective for developing modules in medical education specifically in pediatrics. This module was well received by the students and greatly improved their knowledge and skills. Modular teaching is an alternative to traditional methods, emphasizing its potential to enhance comprehension, fostering a more interactive learning environment, and an excellent approach for developing real-life management skills among medical students. It can be used to create modules for other topics in pediatrics and can also be applied to develop modules in other subjects.",2025,[],[]
Obesity as a risk factor for early-onset colorectal cancer: Evidence from a nationally representative database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with an alarming rise in early-onset CRC (eoCRC) over the past several decades. Unlike late-onset CRC, the drivers behind eoCRC remain less clear. While certain risk factors such as obesity and smoking have demonstrated a relatively strong association with eoCRC in the literature, some studies have challenged these associations, emphasizing the need for additional studies.<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate the impact of various risk factors on eoCRC with a special focus on obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study used de-identified data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2023), including 30321 United States adults aged 18 to 49 years. Participants with missing key variables were excluded. Standardized protocols were used to collect demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric [body mass index (BMI), body roundness index (BRI), waist circumference (WC)], and self-reported CRC data. Logistic regression and propensity score matching assessed associations between obesity-related parameters and eoCRC. Statistical analyses were performed in R and Stata, with <i>P</i> < 0.05 defined as significant.<h4>Results</h4>Of 30321 participants, 48 received a diagnosis of eoCRC. Patients with eoCRC were older (mean age 39.96 years <i>vs</i> 34.36 years; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and had higher WC and BRI. None of the eoCRC patients were heavy drinkers (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Unadjusted models demonstrated significant associations of eoCRC with BRI quartiles, as well as BMI-defined obesity, WC, and smoking. In unadjusted models, BRI remained the strongest independent predictor; those in the highest BRI quartiles had over 10-fold greater odds of eoCRC. In fully adjusted models, BRI remained significant, but BMI- and waist-based obesity were not.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BRI is a stronger predictor of eoCRC risk compared to other obesity indices and is a superior tool for identifying young individuals at higher risk of CRC.",2025,[],[]
GLP-1 and Its Role in Glycogen Production: A Narrative Review.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has emerged as a pivotal regulator in the management of glucose homeostasis, glycogen metabolism, and energy balance, positioning it as a critical therapeutic target for addressing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have shown promise for improving glycemic control and reducing weight through appetite regulation, delayed gastric emptying, and energy expenditure modulation. This narrative review explores the mechanisms of GLP-1-mediated glycogen metabolism and energy expenditure, particularly in key tissues-pancreas, liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. In the pancreas, GLP-1 enhances insulin secretion and beta-cell function. In the liver, it promotes glycogen synthesis via insulin-dependent and potential insulin-independent pathways, involving protein kinase B (AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. Skeletal muscle benefits from GLP-1 through increased glucose uptake, AMPK activation, and mitochondrial function, facilitating glycogen storage. In adipose tissue, GLP-1 stimulates brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and energy expenditure, contributing to weight loss. This increase in energy expenditure, along with enhanced glycogen metabolism, is a plausible mechanism for the weight loss observed with GLP-1RAs. Despite these advances, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the direct hepatic effects of GLP-1, the extent to which it modulates glycogen metabolism in vivo, and its impact on thermogenesis in humans. Future research focusing on both the tissue-specific actions of GLP-1 and its systemic role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation will be essential for optimizing its therapeutic potential.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1 receptor', '##nist', 'glp - 1ras', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'protein kinase b', 'a', '##kt', 'amp - activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'glp - 1', 'ampk', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1']","['glucagon like peptide 1', 'glp 1', 'glp 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'protein kinase b', 'amp activated protein kinase', 'ampk']"
The age of obesity onset affects changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue macrophages and T cells after weight loss.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Adipose tissue inflammation, driven in part by immune cells, may contribute to the elevated type 2 diabetes risk in adults with childhood-onset obesity (CO) compared to those with adult-onset obesity (AO). Weight loss can modify adipose tissue immune cell composition, but whether these changes differ by obesity onset remains unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared abdominal and femoral subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) immune cell percentages between people with CO and AO before and after moderate (~10%) weight loss. We collected abdominal and femoral SAT from females with CO or AO before (CO: <i>n</i>=14; AO: <i>n</i>=13) and after (CO: <i>n</i>=8; AO: <i>n</i>=6) diet- and exercise-induced weight loss. We used flow cytometry to quantify the percentages of macrophages and T cells in the stromovascular fraction of both SAT regions.<h4>Results</h4>Abdominal CD68<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>- '</sup>pro-inflammatory' macrophages were slightly higher in AO than CO at baseline but declined in AO only, equalizing between groups after weight loss. Femoral CD68<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>-</sup> macrophages, as well as abdominal and femoral CD68<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> 'anti-inflammatory' macrophages and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, did not differ between groups at baseline or change after weight loss. Abdominal and femoral CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells-potentially pro- or anti-inflammatory-increased after weight loss in AO but remained unchanged in CO.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings, though preliminary, do not support the hypothesis that SAT immune cell profiles account for the elevated type 2 diabetes risk in CO. Weight loss appears to alter some immune cell populations in AO but not in CO. The long-term metabolic consequences of these changes-or lack thereof-remain to be determined.",2025,"['cd68', 'cd', 'cd68', 'cd', 'cd68', 'cd', 'cd3', 'cd', 'cd3', 'cd']","['cd68', 'cd3']"
Reduced NRF2/Mfn2 activity promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress and senescence in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in hypertrophic obese mice.,"<h4>Background</h4>Hypertrophy obesity is closely associated with obesity-related metabolic diseases. The senescence of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) is believed to play a significant role in the development of hypertrophy obesity.<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate the relationship between ASC senescence, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NRF2) activity in a mouse model of hypertrophy obesity. Additionally, we explored the mechanism through which NRF2 affects ASC senescence <i>via</i> mitofusin-2 (MFN2).<h4>Methods</h4>We observed the senescent phenotype and ER stress (ERS) in ASCs from hypertrophic obese mouse models, and determined NRF2 activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the transcriptional activity of NRF2 on <i>Mfn2</i>. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to investigate the interaction between MFN2 and binding immunoglobulin protein. The impact of NRF2 and MFN2 on the therapeutic effect of ASC transplantation against insulin resistance was explored through ASC transplantation.<h4>Results</h4>The study found significant increases in senescence and ERS, accompanied by decreased NRF2 activity in ASCs from hypertrophic obese mouse models. Simultaneously, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR analysis revealed a reduction in NRF2 transcriptional activity on <i>Mfn2</i>. The downregulation of NRF2 activity and <i>Mfn2</i> expression promoted senescence and ERS in ASCs, subsequently impacting the anti-insulin resistance effect of ASC transplantation. Furthermore, there exists a direct or indirect binding between MFN2 and binding immunoglobulin protein.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The research outcomes suggest that NRF2 may regulate ERS and senescence in subcutaneous ASCs of hypertrophic obese mice by modulating <i>Mfn2</i>.

Cardiovascular Assessments in Children and Adolescents With Hypertension.,"Cardiovascular assessments in children and adolescents with hypertension are essential for detecting early signs of organ damage and guiding timely interventions. The pathophysiology of pediatric hypertension involves a complex interplay of arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, metabolic disturbances, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and immune dysregulation. These mechanisms collectively contribute to target organ damage, particularly in the cardiovascular system. Traditional office-based blood pressure measurements often fail to identify individuals at high risk, prompting the adoption of more advanced diagnostic techniques. Measures of arterial stiffness, such as pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and cardio-ankle vascular index, provide valuable insights into vascular health and have been strongly associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and impaired heart function. Imaging modalities, including carotid intima-media thickness and epicardial adipose tissue measurements, serve as indicators of subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. Advanced echocardiographic tools that assess myocardial strain and ventricular-arterial coupling provide a more nuanced understanding of cardiac performance in hypertensive adolescents. These advanced techniques enhance the early detection of cardiovascular abnormalities and support a more individualized approach to managing pediatric hypertension. However, challenges related to validation, standardization, and clinical integration remain. Thus, expanding access to these modalities and refining their use in pediatric populations are crucial steps toward improving long-term cardiovascular outcomes in youth with elevated blood pressure.",2025,"['renin', 'an', '##giotensin']",['renin']
"The Relationship Between Obesity and Cancer: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and the Effect of Obesity Treatment on Cancer.","There is growing evidence relating to the risk of cancer in people with obesity.

Exploring the efficacy of Benincasa hispida extract on obesity linked inflammatory bowel disease by integrating computational analysis and experimental validations.,"The association of obesity with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be understood by the intricate role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, especially adipokines, which are secreted by adipose tissue and are responsible for IBD because of their structural similarity with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), an important cytokine involved in IBD pathogenesis. The current study was carried out to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Benincasa hispida in obesity-associated IBD. Approximately 18 compounds sourced from Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) were comprehensively analyzed, among which 11 presented favorable drug-likeness scores and adherence to Lipinski's Rule of Five. Various methodologies, including compound-gene set pathway enrichment analysis, network pharmacology, docking studies, and molecular dynamics simulations, have been employed. Safety assessments via Protox confirmed the nontoxic nature of these compounds, which is crucial for their therapeutic potential. Through Venn diagram analysis of the Gene Card and OMIM databases, proteins associated with obesity and IBD management were pinpointed. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed 810 targets across 192 distinct pathways, with 8 directly related to the pathogenesis of obesity and IBD. Notable therapeutic targets, such as MTOR, were identified through STRING and KEGG pathway database analyses, shedding light on the molecular pathways modulated by these protein targets. Interactions among compounds, proteins, and pathways were visualized via Cytoscape 3.6.1. Furthermore, the compounds were docked with the protein target via AutoDock 4.2, and the compound ajmalin exhibited the highest binding affinity with the MTOR protein, with a binding energy of -7.8 kcal/mol; later, a dynamic study was performed for the ajmaline and protein complex. These findings shed light on the potential efficacy of Benincasa hispida in targeting crucial pathways for managing obesity and IBD. Hence, in vivo studies involving Wistar rats exposed to microplastics and monosodium glutamate (MSG) were carried out to evaluate the potential of Benincasa hispida extracts in mitigating obesity-related IBD. Fecal lipid analysis revealed alterations associated with these conditions, whereas histopathological examinations of the liver and intestine revealed the inflammatory changes induced by MSG and microplastics. The protective effects of this extract on liver and intestinal histology suggest promising avenues for further investigations, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic intervention for IBD and obesity.",2025,"['tumor necrosis factor - alpha', 'tnf - α', 'mtor', 'mtor protein', '##sg']","['tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'mtor', 'mtor protein']"
Cnot4 heterozygosity attenuates high fat diet-induced obesity in mice and impairs PPARγ-mediated adipocyte differentiation.,"Adipocyte differentiation is crucial for formation and expansion of white adipose tissue and is also associated with the pathologies of obesity. CNOT4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and also contains RNA binding domain. In mammals CNOT4 has been suggested to interact with CCR4-NOT complex, a major executor of mRNA poly(A) shortening. While several subunits within the CCR4-NOT complex were shown to be involved in obesity and energy metabolism, the roles of CNOT4 in obesity remain unexplored. In this study, we generated and analyzed Cnot4 knockout mice and found that Cnot4 heterozygous (Cnot4 Het) mice exhibit resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity, including significant reduction in adipose tissue mass and hepatic lipid depots. However, Cnot4 Het did not affect mRNA expression of metabolic genes as well as serum lipid levels or glucose tolerance. On the other hand, Cnot4 Het fibroblasts significantly reduced the capability of differentiation into adipocytes and down-regulated adipogenic gene expression compared to wild type fibroblasts. Mechanistically, heterozygous deletion of Cnot4 down-regulated the transcriptional activity through decreased binding of PPARγ to promoter region of the target gene, thereby suppressing up-regulation of adipocyte marker gene expression in response to rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist. These results suggest that CNOT4 mediates adipocyte differentiation during formation and growth of adipose tissue partly through positively regulating transcriptional activity of PPARγ.",2025,"['cnot4', 'e3 ubiquitin ligase', 'cnot4', 'ccr4 - not complex', 'ccr4 - not complex', 'cnot4', 'cnot4', 'cnot4', 'cnot4 het', 'cnot4 het', 'cnot4', 'cnot4', 'pparγ', 'pparγ', 'cnot4', 'pparγ']","['cnot4', 'e3 ubiquitin ligase', 'pparγ']"

Contemporary guidelines recommend optimising cardiometabolic care, including achieving a target glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <7%, blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, and use of pharmacotherapy, including the maximal tolerated statin dose and consideration of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in selected subpopulations.<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to determine whether cardiometabolic treatment targets and pharmacological management met best practice guidelines in two rural Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations.<h4>Method</h4>A retrospective audit of electronic medical records was conducted in two rural Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations between January 2020 and January 2021. Data were collected for people aged over 18 years who regularly attended the clinic, identified as Aboriginal, and had a documented diagnosis of T2DM.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 274 patients met the inclusion criteria, 64% of whom were female. The median age of T2DM diagnosis was 44 years (interquartile range 32-50), with a median diabetes duration of 9 years (3-17), HbA1c 8.0% (6.9-9.4), body mass index 31.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (27-36.3), urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) 3.8 mg/mol (1.1-20.0), and mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol 2.1 mmol/L (±0.8). Capture rates were 70% for HbA1c, 51% for urine ACR, and 51% for lipid studies. Among recorded results, 51/193 (26%) of HbA1c were <7%, 80/228 (35%) of blood pressure readings were below 130/80 mmHg.

Depletion of Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Protein (FTO) Drives Heterochromatin Loss via Lysine Acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8)-Mediated Remodeling and Spacing Factor 1 (RSF1) Acetylation in Skin Aging.,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), as the most common RNA modification at the post-transcriptional level, plays a role in various pathophysiological processes. However, its underlying mechanism in skin aging remains enigmatic. Here, we identified that fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) serves as a protective factor against skin aging. FTO expression is downregulated in aging skin tissues and senescent fibroblasts. Furthermore, the depletion or inhibition of FTO exacerbates dermal fibroblasts senescence and accelerates skin aging. Additionally, RNA-seq combined with MeRIP-seq revealed that lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) is the downstream target of FTO. FTO deficiency leads to an increase in m6A levels and a decrease in mRNA stability of KAT8 in a m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner. Notably, our integrated analysis of m6A sequencing and acetylation proteomics links changes in heterochromatin structure with aging. Mechanistically, KAT8 depletion leads to heterochromatin loss and the subsequent aging by acetylating remodeling and spacing factor 1 (RSF1) at K1050. Overall, our finding reveals a pivotal role of FTO-mediated m6A modification in the skin aging by regulating KAT8/RSF1-involved heterochromatin formation. It provides new insights into the mechanisms and strategies for delaying aging and improving healthspan.",2025,"['obesity - associated protein', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'lysine acetyltransferase 8', 'kat8', 'fto', 'fto', 'm6a', 'kat8', 'm6a', 'y', '##thdf2', 'm6a', 'kat8', 'remodeling and spacing factor 1', 'rsf1', 'fto', 'm', 'kat8', 'rsf1']","['fto', 'lysine acetyltransferase 8', 'kat8', 'm6a', 'remodeling and spacing factor 1', 'rsf1']"
Development of the Pediatric Weight Questionnaire (PWQ™) for Children and Adolescents with Obesity.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Development of obesity management medications (OMMs) for use in children and adolescents calls for patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures to evaluate treatment efficacy. Existing weight-specific symptom and impact PROs are limited to age ≥ 11 years and may not fully capture treatment benefit of new OMMs.<h4>Methods</h4>A targeted literature review was conducted to identify obesity symptom and impact outcomes and weight-specific PROs relevant to children and adolescents 6-17 years of age. Concept elicitation (CE) interviews were conducted by telephone with children and adolescents, including parents of children 6-11 years of age, to identify relevant weight-specific concepts. Key concepts relevant to three developmental age groups-6-7, 8-11, and 12-17 years-informed the creation of a pediatric weight-specific PRO to assess key symptoms and impacts of obesity: the Pediatric Weight Questionnaire (PWQ). Cognitive interviews (CI) were conducted by telephone to assess the comprehension, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the PWQ across the three age groups.<h4>Results</h4>Eight domains were identified from the literature as relevant to pediatric obesity: physical symptoms, physical function, psychological health, emotional behavior/function, family and social relationships, school functioning, and health-related quality of life. No existing weight-specific PRO encompassing these domains was identified. Twenty CE interview participants (mean age 11.4 years, 60% female, 50% Hispanic/Latino) confirmed that physical symptoms and physical, emotional, and social impacts were most relevant to their weight experience. The 23-item PWQ for adolescents 12-17 years of age and the 17-item PWQ for children 8-11 years of age are self-administered, while the 13-item PWQ for children 6-7 years of age is interviewer-administered. The three versions of the PWQ were evaluated with 34 CI participants (mean age 12 years, 64.7% female, 17.6% Hispanic/Latino), who found the PWQ easy to complete, relevant, and comprehensive.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PWQ provides a means of assessing the impact of obesity and benefits of treatment in children and adolescents 6-17 years of age with obesity.

White Adipocyte Stem Cell Expansion Through Infant Formula Feeding: New Insights into Epigenetic Programming Explaining the Early Protein Hypothesis of Obesity.,"Prolonged breastfeeding (BF), as opposed to artificial infant formula feeding (FF), has been shown to prevent the development of obesity later in life. The aim of our narrative review is to investigate the missing molecular link between postnatal protein overfeeding-often referred to as the ""early protein hypothesis""-and the subsequent transcriptional and epigenetic changes that accelerate the expansion of adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) in the adipose vascular niche during postnatal white adipose tissue (WAT) development. To achieve this, we conducted a search on the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases from 2000 to 2025 and reviewed 750 papers. Our findings revealed that the overactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which inhibits wingless (Wnt) signaling due to protein overfeeding, serves as the primary pathway promoting ASC commitment and increasing preadipocyte numbers. Moreover, excessive protein intake, combined with the upregulation of the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (<i>FTO</i>) and a deficiency of breast milk-derived microRNAs from lactation, disrupts the proper regulation of <i>FTO</i> and Wnt pathway components. This disruption enhances ASC expansion in WAT while inhibiting brown adipose tissue development. While BF has been shown to have protective effects against obesity, the postnatal transcriptional and epigenetic changes induced by excessive protein intake from FF may predispose infants to early and excessive ASC commitment in WAT, thereby increasing the risk of obesity later in life.",2025,"['me', 'target of rapamycin complex 1', 'mtorc1', 's6 kinase 1', 's6k1', 'wingless', 'wnt', 'wnt']","['target of rapamycin complex 1', 'mtorc1', 's6k1', 'wnt']"

BMI differences on anticoagulation with bivalirudin vs. heparin during primary PCI: a BRIGHT-4 subanalysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Body mass index (BMI) is associated with ischemic and bleeding events in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Procedural anticoagulation with bivalirudin followed by a prolonged high-dose post-PCI infusion was shown in the BRIGHT-4 trial to reduce mortality and major bleeding compared with heparin monotherapy. We aimed to assess the outcomes of bivalirudin compared with heparin in relation to BMI in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI.<h4>Methods</h4>This prespecified subgroup analysis from the BRIGHT-4 trial evaluated the treatment effects of bivalirudin with a high-dose infusion for 2-4 h after primary PCI compared with heparin monotherapy in 6,016 randomized STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI predominantly via radial artery access stratified according to baseline BMI. A total of 3284 (54.6%) patients had a BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the pre-specified stratification threshold.<h4>Results</h4>The primary endpoint of all-cause death or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 3-5 bleeding events at 30 days in all enrolled patients occurred less often in patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared with those with BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [2.9% vs. 4.4%; unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.87; P = 0.003], which was no longer significant after adjusting for confounders (adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74-1.31; P = 0.92). Bivalirudin reduced the rate of the primary endpoint compared with heparin in patients with BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (3.2% vs. 5.7%; adjusted HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.79) but not in those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (2.9% vs. 2.9%; adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62-1.52; P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.04). A similar pattern was observed for the individual components of the primary endpoint, as well as for the composite of all-cause death or BARC types 2-5 bleeding.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Anticoagulation with bivalirudin followed by a prolonged high-dose infusion reduced the composite endpoint of all-cause death or BARC types 3-5 bleeding in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI with lower BMI but not in those with higher BMI compared with heparin monotherapy.<h4>Trial registration</h4>The BRIGHT-4 trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03822975).",2025,[],[]
Targeting the cGAS-STING Pathway to Modulate Immune Inflammation in Diabetes and Cardiovascular Complications: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Insights.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterized by insulin resistance and chronic hyperglycemia, markedly increases the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Emerging preclinical evidence identifies the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway as a critical mediator of diabetic cardiovascular inflammation. Metabolic stressors in T2DM-hyperglycemia, lipotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction-induce leakage of mitochondrial and microbial double-stranded DNA into the cytosol, where it engages cGAS and activates STING. Subsequent TBK1/IRF3 and NF-κB signaling drives low-grade inflammation across cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of cGAS or STING in high-fat-diet-fed diabetic mice reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis, limits atherosclerotic lesion formation, and preserves cardiac contractile performance. Pharmacological inhibitors, including RU.521 (cGAS antagonist), C-176/H-151 (STING palmitoylation blockers), and the TBK1 inhibitor amlexanox, effectively lower pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and improve left ventricular ejection fraction in diabetic cardiomyopathy and ischemia-reperfusion injury models. Novel PROTAC degraders targeting cGAS/STING and natural products such as Astragaloside IV and Tanshinone IIA further support the pathway's druggability. Collectively, these findings position the cGAS-STING axis as a central molecular nexus linking metabolic derangement to cardiovascular pathology in T2DM and underscore its inhibition or targeted degradation as a promising dual cardiometabolic therapeutic strategy.",2025,"['insulin', 'cyclic gmp - amp synthase', 'stimulator of interferon genes', 'cgas', 'sting', 'cgas', 'tbk1', 'irf3', 'nf - κb', 'cgas', 'nlrp3', 'cgas', '- 176', '-', 'tbk1', 'il - 1β', 'il - 6', 't', '##nf - α', 'protac', 'cgas', 'sting', 'cgas', 'sting']","['insulin', 'stimulator of interferon genes', 'cgas', 'sting', 'tbk1', 'irf3', 'nlrp3']"
Reduced metformin concentrations in obese women with HIV treated with dolutegravir.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity among women with HIV (WWH) is nearly 2-fold higher than in men. Obesity is closely associated with dysglycemia, and frequently necessitates the co-administration of dolutegravir and metformin. A pharmacokinetic study in 15 non-obese healthy volunteers determined that dolutegravir increased metformin plasma exposure by 79%, prompting regulatory and guideline recommendations to limit metformin to 1,000 mg/day when co-administered with dolutegravir. Obesity has been linked to lower metformin exposures, and our study aimed to verify the metformin pharmacokinetic exposure in the increasing population of obese WWH.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted intensive plasma sampling in virally-suppressed WWH receiving metformin extended-release 1,000 mg once-daily with concomitant dolutegravir 50 mg once-daily. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed to quantify body-fat composition. Non-compartmental analysis of metformin and dolutegravir concentrations was performed, and our findings compared to the reference study.<h4>Results</h4>We enrolled 15 participants with a mean body mass index of 45.6 kg/m2. Metformin AUC0-24 was 40.9% lower and dolutegravir AUC0-24 was 54.4% lower in obese WWH compared to the reference study. Metformin and dolutegravir clearance were 1.7- and 2.2-fold higher, respectively. Linear regression did not show associations between body-fat composition and metformin or dolutegravir exposures.<h4>Discussion</h4>Limiting metformin to 1,000 mg daily is likely to lead to underdosing in obese WWH on dolutegravir. Lower metformin exposure appears to be due to the reduced inhibitory effect of lower dolutegravir concentrations on metformin clearance and increased volume of distribution due to obesity. Our data support the revision of the current maximum dose restriction of metformin in the target population of obese WWH.",2025,[],[]
What Is the Potential Relevance of Growth and Differentiation Factor-15 in Neurologic Disease?,"Growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a multifunctional cytokine that is a distant member of both the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family.<sup>1-6</sup> GDF-15 is released in physiologic conditions, such as pregnancy or muscle exercise, but its levels increase particularly in the setting of cellular stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue injury.<sup>7,8</sup> GDF-15 is a central inhibitor of appetite<sup>9,10</sup> and regulates energy homeostasis,<sup>2-5</sup> inflammation,<sup>11</sup> and carcinogenesis<sup>12</sup> (Figure).

Perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing a weight management programme in a primary care setting in Singapore: a qualitative study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity, a growing problem worldwide and locally, is a risk factor for many chronic conditions. Weight loss has been shown to improve health outcomes and weight management programmes are effective in achieving weight loss. However, the effectiveness and sustainability of weight management programmes are variable. The six-month, seven-touch-point Weight Management Programme (WeightWise) is a locally developed multidisciplinary programme based on the latest evidence and expert opinion. This study aimed to explore the perceived barriers and facilitators to delivering WeightWise prior to its implementation in the Singapore public primary care setting (polyclinics).<h4>Methods</h4>Between September 2023 and January 2024, a qualitative study was conducted across two polyclinics designated to pilot WeightWise. Twenty-six healthcare practitioners, including clinic directors, doctors, nurses, dietitians and physiotherapists, who would be involved in running WeightWise or referring patients to WeightWise, were interviewed by the researchers using an interview guide, in either a focus group or individually. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, checked and analysed thematically using the NVivo software.<h4>Results</h4>The participants in this study expressed a gap in weight management in primary care and found WeightWise relevant and timely. However, they highlighted potential barriers to implementing WeightWise in terms of patient enrolment and programme delivery. For enrolment to WeightWise, the participants were concerned about a lack of prioritisation by the practitioners on weight management, time constraint, complex referral criteria and pricing. However, they highlighted potential facilitators to enrolment including targeting young and motivated patients, as well as identifying eligible patients at pre-consult vitals measurement stations. For WeightWise delivery, the perceived barriers were: increased workload for nurses, difficulty in accessing information on community exercise programmes, lack of weight management knowledge amongst practitioners, inconvenient programme timings and uncertainty in long-term benefits of WeightWise. The perceived facilitators to delivering WeightWise were: the use of remote care modalities, preventive care awareness through Healthier SG (a national health initiative), training programmes for practitioners and continuous peer support for patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified the need to focus on both enrolment and delivery when implementing WeightWise. It also identified low prioritisation of weight management, lack of practitioner knowledge, lack of resources and costs as key barriers when implementing a weight management programme. Tailored healthcare professionals training, additional resources and cost analysis is recommended before its implementation.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.",2025,[],[]
The Impact of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists on Erectile Function: Friend or Foe?,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common yet frequently underrecognized microvascular complication of diabetes, affecting up to three out of four individuals. Key contributing factors include advancing age, long-standing disease duration, and suboptimal glycemic control, as well as insulin resistance and androgen deficiency-the latter being particularly common in men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. While numerous studies have investigated the effects of various antidiabetic therapies on diabetes-related ED, the results remain inconsistent, limiting definitive conclusions. In recent years, increasing attention has focused on a novel class of antidiabetic medications, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These agents have become central to the treatment of T2D due to their potent glucose-lowering properties and well-documented benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, and weight loss. Given these pleiotropic effects, GLP-1 RAs have been presumed to positively influence erectile function-a hypothesis supported by a growing body of experimental and clinical research. However, preliminary reports have also raised concerns about a possible association between GLP-1 RA use and ED. This narrative review aims to synthesize current evidence regarding the impact of GLP-1 RAs on erectile function, providing a platform for future research in this evolving field.",2025,"['insulin', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ra', 'glp - 1 ras']","['insulin', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']"
Circulating microRNAs as Potential Biomarkers of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: A Narrative Review.,"In an obesogenic environment, such as the one we have been experiencing in recent decades, epigenetics provides answers to the relationship between hereditary and environmentally acquired patterns that have significantly contributed to the global rise in obesity prevalence. MicroRNA (miRNA) constitutes a diminutive non-coding small RNA molecule, 20 to 24 nucleotides in length, that functions as a regulator of gene regulation at the post-translational level. Circulating miRNAs (c-miRNAs) have been detected in multiple body fluids, including blood, plasma, serum, saliva, milk from breastfeeding mothers, and urine. These molecules hold significant therapeutic value and serve as extracellular biomarkers in metabolic diseases. They aid in the diagnosis and tracking of therapy responses, as well as dietary and physical habit modifications. Researchers have studied c-miRNAs as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and characterizing systemic diseases in people of all ages and backgrounds since then. These conditions encompass dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular risk, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. This review therefore analyzes the usefulness of c-miRNAs as therapeutic markers over the past decades. It also provides an update on c-miRNAs associated with general obesity and overweight, as well as with the most prevalent pathologies in the adult population. It also examines the effect of different nutritional approaches and physical activity regarding the activity of miRNAs in circulation in adults with overweight or general obesity. All of this is done with the aim of evaluating their potential use as biomarkers in various research contexts related to overweight and obesity in adults.",2025,['c'],[]
Exploring the Link Between the Gut Microbiota and Epigenetic Factors in Anorexia Nervosa.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an often chronic eating disorder that involves genetic, neurohormonal, and epigenetic factors along with key contributions from the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, interactions between these factors are poorly understood. Recent studies have emphasized the microbiota-gut-brain axis and epigenetic changes as potentially important contributors to AN. Exploring these interactions may improve understanding of the etiology and persistence of AN.<h4>Methods</h4>Studies specifically addressing microbial-epigenetic interactions in AN remain limited. However, similar associations have been documented in related disorders such as obesity and depression, providing potential models for AN research.<h4>Results</h4>Research in obesity has shown that dietary factors influence the composition of the gut microbiota and subsequent epigenetic modifications, affecting metabolic parameters and disease progression. Similarly, in depression, microbially produced metabolites influence brain function and epigenetic processes, contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms. In AN, altered microbial composition may affect weight regulation and epigenetic patterns. Therapies targeting the microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, are under investigation for AN, highlighting the potential therapeutic utility of ameliorating microbial dysbiosis.<h4>Discussion</h4>This article highlights the importance of investigating microbial-epigenetic interactions in AN. By drawing parallels with obesity and depression, we aim to deepen our understanding of AN mechanisms and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",2025,[],[]
Exploring possible hub genes of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic network biology study.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), often termed ""glucolipotoxicity"" or insulin resistance syndrome, are complex metabolic disorders typically managed by lifestyle interventions and oral hypoglycemic agents. While conventional drugs, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, show efficacy, they also present risks such as hypoglycemia and weight gain. Among these, metformin remains the preferred first-line treatment due to its safety, low cost, and minimal side effects. However, the multifactorial nature of MetS/T2DM, coupled with increased cardiovascular risk, demands novel therapeutic strategies targeting broader disease-specific mediators. This study employs network pharmacology to identify potential gene targets linked to MetS/T2DM. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of 97 genes involved in the pathophysiology of these disorders, identifying 89 interlinked genes. The top 10 crucial genes including insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and interleukin-6 (IL6) are highlighted as key contributors to disease progression. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed their involvement in essential biological processes like peptide synthesis, lipid regulation, and glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, nine of these genes are influenced by metformin, suggesting its broader mechanism in modulating metabolic pathways. Additionally, scrutiny of transcription factors for the considered dataset shows that forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) play crucial roles in insulin signalling, mitochondrial function, and glucose metabolism, further elucidating the molecular complexity of T2DM.

Illuminating the Druggable Proteome with an AI Protein Profiling Platform,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Creating a ligandable atlas for the proteome would transform our understanding of protein functions and accelerate therapeutic discovery; however, proteomic approaches are constrained by insufficient proteome coverage and data heterogeneity, while existing machine learning (ML) models have limited power due to structural dependencies and heterogeneous experimental labels. Here we developed AiPP, a multimodal AI platform that predicts and characterizes ligand interaction sites directly from protein sequence. AiPP is powered by the evolutionary-scale protein large language models (LLMs) and leverages two harmonized ML training sets derived from the new databases comprising cysteine ligandability from activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) studies and reversible binding evidenced from co-crystal structures. We developed a LLM representation based clustering framework to interrogate, reconcile, and augment experimental labels in both databases. Two complementary protocols were implemented to iteratively expand the training data while improving model performance. Although trained exclusively on ABPP data, AiPP recovers 80% (Top-1) of cysteine liganding events from cocrystal structures, with 84% AUPRC and 89% AUROC. AiPP recapitulates consistently and heterogeneously liganded cysteines across cancer cell lines and reliably identifies dynamic, ligandable pockets in ``undruggable'' transcription factors. Remarkably, AiPP accurately predicts active-site and allosteric cysteines in protein tyrosine phosphatases that were undetected by ABPP. Finally, we applied AiPP to the entire human proteome, identifying ligandable sites in proteins that were undetected or unliganded by ABPP, including an allosteric site in MC3R, which is a therapeutic target for treatment of eating disorder and obesity. This proteomewide covalent ligandability atlas (version 1.0) is anticipated to guide future development of chemical probes and pharmaceutical modulators, particularly for understudied proteins and currently undruggable targets. The LLM-based approach to interrogate large-scale heterogeneous data is broadly applicable to protein research and development of proteomics-derived ML models for diverse applications.</p>",2025,"['ab', 'protein tyrosine phosphatases', '##b', 'abpp', 'mc3r']","['protein tyrosine phosphatases', 'abpp', 'mc3r']"
Effectiveness and tolerability of liraglutide as add-on treatment in patients with obesity and high-frequency or chronic migraine: A prospective pilot study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To assess whether glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists could serve as a novel prophylactic treatment for migraine in patients with obesity.<h4>Background</h4>Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is speculated to play a role in migraine mechanisms, as chronic migraine and idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIWHOP) are often clinically indistinguishable. These striking similarities suggest a deep pathogenetic link between the two conditions posing the hypothesis that control of ICP may be helpful in migraine treatment. The GLP-1R agonists have been shown to greatly reduce ICP. Notably, they have also been demonstrated to decrease calcitonin gene-related peptide expression in chronic migraine models.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a prospective, interventional, open-label, pilot cohort study, evaluating the effectiveness of liraglutide as an add-on treatment of unresponsive migraine in patients with obesity. We consecutively enrolled patients with high-frequency or chronic migraine and a body mass index (BMI) of >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and unresponsive to at least two preventive treatments. We excluded patients with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, or pulsatile tinnitus, to rule out patients in which idiopathic intracranial hypertension could be clinically suspected. Liraglutide was administered 1.2 mg daily. The study was conducted from January to July 2024, with a 12-week follow-up period. The primary outcome of this study was the reduction of monthly days with headache after 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide compared to baseline.<h4>Results</h4>We enrolled 31 patients (26 females, five males, with a mean [standard deviation, SD] age of 44.9 [14.6] years). The mean (SD) monthly days with headache decreased from 19.8 (6.7) to 10.7 (7.7) days post-treatment. This change was significant with a mean difference of 9.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.41-12.84, p < 0.001, Cohen's d: 0.90). Conversely, BMI decreased slightly from a mean (SD) of 34.0 (2.3) to 33.9 (2.3) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and this change was not significant (mean difference = 0.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI -0.004 to 0.153 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.060, Cohen's d: 0.34). Analysis of covariance indicated that age, sex, and concomitant medications did not significantly influence headache frequency reduction (all p > 0.050). Simple linear regression analysis showed that BMI reduction did not significantly predict headache frequency reduction (β = -1.448, 95% CI -19.390 to 16.495, p = 0.870, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.001), indicating no meaningful relationship between the two variables.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings show that liraglutide may be effective in the treatment of unresponsive high-frequency or chronic migraine in patients with obesity, and that this effect is independent from weight loss. Although further studies are needed to clarify this topic, these findings generate the hypothesis that a derangement in ICP control may play a role in migraine pathogenesis and potentially represent a novel therapeutic target.",2025,"['glucagon - like - peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r', 'calcitonin gene - related peptide']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'calcitonin gene related peptide']"

TREM2 as a regulator of obesity-induced cardiac remodeling: mechanisms and therapeutic insights.,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are global health challenges that significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Advances in immunometabolism have identified triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) as a key regulator of macrophage function, lipid metabolism, and inflammation resolution. Although extensively studied in neurodegenerative diseases, TREM2's role in metabolic disorders and cardiovascular health is an emerging area of research. This review explores TREM2's molecular structure and functions, emphasizing its contributions to immunometabolic regulation in obesity and T2DM. Evidence from preclinical models demonstrates that TREM2 modulates macrophage-driven inflammatory responses, lipid clearance, plaque stability, fibrosis, and myocardial remodeling. Translational findings suggest that TREM2 expression correlates with cardiometabolic outcomes, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. Key knowledge gaps include TREM2's temporal dynamics during disease progression, sex-specific effects, and interactions with recruited or resident macrophage activation in obesity and T2DM. Integrating mechanistic and translational insights is critical to harness TREM2's immunoregulatory potential for improving CVD outcomes in metabolic disorders.",2025,"['2', 'trem2', 'trem2', 'trem2', 'trem2', 'trem2', 'trem2', 'trem2']",['trem2']
"Advancing knowledge, maps and tools to address obesity and related socio-economic disparities in Europe: the OBCT project.","The steady rise in overweight and obesity in Europe disproportionately affects people and communities with a lower socio-economic position (SEP). Many obesity prevention approaches exist, but these have had limited reach and unsatisfactory effects thus far, especially in low-SEP populations. In this context, there is a need for implementation of effective individual-level and population-based preventive strategies that also tackle health inequalities. Effective strategies require consideration of the complex and cross-domain obesity risk factors across the life course. Feasible and acceptable strategies require multisectoral collaborations and innovative approaches, including a whole-of community and systems perspective. With the Horizon Europe-funded OBCT project, we aim to quantify the relative contribution of biological, socio-cultural and built environment factors to obesity and the interactions of these risks within and across various life course stages; and translate the resulting knowledge into practical, equitable, and effective tools for action. These tools will include: a comprehensive obesity risk screener; a map of the obesogenicity of neighbourhood environments as well as trends in obesity prevalence of each European country; recommendations for lifestyle behaviours (diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviours) to prevent obesity during key life transition stages; a decision support dashboard for policy makers; and co-developed toolboxes to support implementation of policy recommendations in low-SEP communities. OBCT's outputs will highlight the areas and domains in which obesity should be targeted and will empower the research community, policymakers, health professionals and residents in Europe to adapt and implement strategies to effectively reduce obesity risk, particularly in low-SEP communities.",2025,[],[]

Immune Microenvironment Dysregulation: A Contributing Factor to Obesity-Associated Male Infertility.,"Obesity is a major contributor to male infertility, not only exacerbating infertility but also impairing the effectiveness of both surgical interventions and medical treatments. This review examines the complex relationship between obesity, the immune microenvironment, and male infertility, highlighting how obesity-induced changes in immune function lead to testicular dysfunction and impaired spermatogenesis. Key mechanisms include chronic low-grade inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and dysregulated adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin. We also explore current therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating these effects, including lifestyle interventions, anti-inflammatory treatments, metabolic therapies, and regenerative medicine approaches, such as exosome-based therapies. Despite promising results, substantial research gaps remain, particularly in understanding the molecular mechanisms and identifying novel biomarkers for early diagnosis. Future studies should focus on multi-omics approaches, large-scale cohort studies, the gut-testis axis, and the psychological and social factors influencing male infertility. A deeper understanding of these processes is crucial for developing more effective, targeted therapies for obesity-related male infertility.",2025,"['leptin', 'adiponectin']","['leptin', 'adiponectin']"
Predictors of BMI reduction with phentermine/topiramate in adolescents with obesity.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Obesity treatment can produce variable outcomes for different individuals. The aim of this analysis in adolescents with obesity was to investigate if baseline participant characteristics associated with BMI reduction from baseline to 56 weeks when treated with mid- or top-dose phentermine/topiramate (PHEN/TPM) compared to placebo.<h4>Methods</h4>A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial evaluating PHEN/TPM in adolescents with obesity was conducted. Participants, aged 12 to <17 years with a BMI ≥95th percentile, were randomly assigned in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive either placebo, mid-dose (PHEN/TPM 7.5 mg/46 mg) or top-dose (PHEN/TPM 15 mg/92 mg). Baseline characteristics included in the analysis were BMI, age, sex, race/ethnicity, pubertal status, diabetes status, depression status, cognitive function score, and quality of life score. The primary analysis used linear regression with BMI percent change from baseline to 56 weeks as the outcome with either mid- or top-dose PHEN/TPM compared to placebo.<h4>Results</h4>Two-hundred twenty-two participants were included in the final analysis. None of the baseline characteristics were statistically significantly associated with BMI reduction with mid- or top-dose PHEN/TPM compared to placebo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Baseline characteristics were not predictive of BMI reduction with either dose of PHEN/TPM compared to placebo in adolescents with obesity.",2025,[],[]

The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline to week 26.<h4>Results</h4>HR17031 achieved a greater reduction in HbA1c than INS068 and noiiglutide (-2.4% [-26 mmol/mol] vs. -1.5% [-16 mmol/mol] and -1.7% [-19 mmol/mol]), indicating superiority for HR17031 over both INS068 and noiiglutide (least-squares mean difference = -0.9% [-10 mmol/mol] and -0.7% [-7 mmol/mol], respectively; both p < 0.0001). More patients reached HbA1c target <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and ≤6.5% (48 mmol/mol) with HR17031 (<7.0%, 81.4%; ≤6.5%, 74.3%) than INS068 (47.8%; 26.4%) and noiiglutide (55.6%; 41.1%). HR17031 resulted in no weight gain in contrast to INS068 (-0.1 vs. 2.0 kg; p < 0.0001). Incidence of level 2/3 hypoglycaemia was similar with HR17031 (5.5%) and INS068 (4.4%), and lower with noiiglutide (1.1%). HR17031 demonstrated fewer instances of nausea (7.2%), diarrhoea (7.2%), and vomiting (2.8%) than noiiglutide (15.6%, 21.1%, and 20.0%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>HR17031 is effective and well-tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin with or without a second oral antidiabetic drug.",2025,"['insulin', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h']","['insulin', 'glp 1 receptor']"
Evaluation of NPH Insulin Dosing Interval for Critically Ill Hyperglycemic Trauma Patients During Continuous Enteral Nutrition: A Pilot Study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the results of administering subcutaneous neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin every 8 h (NPH-8) versus every 12 h (NPH-12) in critically ill, hyperglycemic trauma patients who required continuous enteral nutrition (EN).<h4>Methods</h4>Both groups of patients were given concurrent sliding scale regular human insulin (SSI) with NPH therapy. The evaluation of glycemic control continued for 7 days.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 15 patients were given NPH every 8 h (NPH-8), and 19 were given NPH every 12 h (NPH-12). Carbohydrate intake was similar between groups (115 ± 35 vs. 108 ± 37 g/d; <i>p</i> = 0.584). There was no significant difference in average blood glucose (BG) concentration (168 ± 18 vs. 166 ± 17 mg/dL; <i>p</i> = 0.803) or time within a BG target range of 70 to 149 mg/dL (7.5 ± 4.7 vs. 8.1 ± 5.0 h/d; <i>p</i> = 0.678) or 70 to 179 mg/dL (14.5 ± 5.0 vs. 16 ± 5.6 h/d; <i>p</i> = 0.419) or the incidence of Level 1 hypoglycemia (2 patients in each group; <i>p</i> = 1.00) or Level 2 hypoglycemia (1 patient vs. 0 patients, <i>p</i> = 0.441) between the NPH-8 and NPH-12 groups, respectively. However, the NPH-8 group required twice as much total (NPH + SSI) insulin (115 ± 52 vs. 58 ± 33 units/d; <i>p</i> = 0.004).<h4>Conclusions</h4>These preliminary data suggest no significant difference between the administration of NPH-8 and NPH-12 based on glycemic control metrics in critically ill hyperglycemic trauma patients given EN. However, these results may be confounded by a selection bias as to who received NPH-8 vs. NPH-12.

Potential impact of controlling risk factors on future liver cancer deaths in China.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to quantify the potential impact of controlling major risk factors on liver cancer deaths in China from 2021 to 2050 under various intervention scenarios.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a macro-level simulation model based on comparative risk assessment to estimate population attributable fractions and avoidable liver cancer deaths. Risk factor prevalence data were obtained from national surveys and epidemiological estimates. Three intervention scenarios for each risk factor were projected: elimination (Scenario 1), ambitious reduction (Scenario 2), and manageable targets aligned with national/global goals (Scenario 3). The impact of secondary prevention through liver cancer screening at different coverage was evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2021 and 2050, liver cancer deaths in China are projected to reach 9.44 million in males and 4.29 million in females. Eliminating hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus could prevent 65.62% (57.47%-73.77%) and 28.47% (24.93%-32.00%) of liver cancer deaths, respectively. Achieving manageable targets in reducing the prevalence of smoking and alcohol drinking could prevent 6.57% (5.75%-7.38%) and 0.85% (0.75%-0.96%) of liver cancer deaths, with a more pronounced effect observed in males. Eliminating high body mass index (BMI) could avert 45,000 male and 25,000 female deaths annually by 2050, while diabetes elimination could prevent 60,000 male and 21,000 female deaths. Secondary prevention through liver cancer screening with 80% coverage could reduce liver cancer deaths by 3.59% (3.14%-4.04%) for the total population. Combining all interventions under Scenario 1 could prevent up to 88.39% (76.65%-99.81%) of male and 77.80% (67.42%-87.88%) of female liver cancer deaths by 2050.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Comprehensive risk factor control could prevent over 80% of liver cancer deaths in China by 2050. Secondary prevention through screening may offer modest additional benefits. These findings provide strong quantitative support for targeted, evidence-based interventions and underscore the need for policy action to address key risk factors.",2025,[],[]

A novel derivative of rhein overcomes temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma by regulating SOX9 through m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation.,"Temozolomide (TMZ) resistance remains a critical barrier to effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive form of glioma. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase, has been implicated in tumor progression and chemoresistance. SYSUP007, a novel derivative of the FTO inhibitor rhein, exhibits anti-glioma activity; however, its role in modulating TMZ resistance remains unexplored. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which SYSUP007 regulates TMZ resistance via FTO signaling. TMZ-resistant glioma cells were subjected to combinatorial treatment with SYSUP007 and TMZ. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT assay, while m<sup>6</sup>A dot blotting was employed to evaluate global m<sup>6</sup>A methylation levels. Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to analyze FTO and downstream target expression. The results revealed that SYSUP007 inhibited glioma cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and synergistically enhanced TMZ sensitivity in vitro. SYSUP007 significantly suppressed FTO expression and elevated m<sup>6</sup>A methylation levels, concomitant with downregulation of the oncogenic FTO target SOX9. Notably, SOX9 expression was markedly upregulated in TMZ-resistant cells compared with parental cells, and SYSUP007 effectively reversed this phenotype. These findings suggest that SYSUP007 potentiates TMZ efficacy by targeting the FTO/m<sup>6</sup>A/SOX9 axis. As a single-molecule multi-target agent, SYSUP007 represents a promising therapeutic candidate to overcome TMZ resistance in glioma.",2025,"['fat mass and obesity - associated protein', 'fto', 'm < sup > 6 < / su', '> a demethylase', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'sox9', 'sox9', 'fto', 'm < su', '>', 'sox9']","['fat mass and obesity associated protein', 'fto', 'sox9']"
Phytotherapy and the Role of Bioactive Compounds in Modulating Mechanisms of Overweight and Obesity Comorbid with Depressive Symptoms-A Scoping Review of Mechanisms of Action.,"Obesity and depression frequently coexist, sharing overlapping molecular pathways such as inflammation, oxidative stress, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and neuroendocrine dysfunction.

Regional anesthesia in bariatric surgery.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Obesity presents significant perioperative challenges, particularly in bariatric surgery, where optimizing pain management while minimizing opioid use is crucial. Recent advancements in regional anesthesia (RA) techniques offer potential benefits in enhancing perioperative outcomes for this high-risk population.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Current evidence supports the use of RA techniques such as transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, quadratus lumborum (QL) block, erector spinae plane (ESP) block, and intraperitoneal instillation of local anesthetics in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption. While TAP and ESP blocks improve postoperative analgesia, the QL block offers longer-lasting pain relief. Intraperitoneal local anesthetic administration has shown potential in decreasing opioid use and improving respiratory recovery. Additionally, port-site infiltration remains a simple yet effective alternative. However, anatomical challenges in obese patients necessitate optimized ultrasound guidance for successful block placement.<h4>Summary</h4>RA is a key component of multimodal analgesia in bariatric surgery, contributing to reduced opioid-related complications and improved recovery. Despite promising findings, further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to refine technique selection and enhance clinical outcomes in this patient population.",2025,[],[]
A combinatorial siRNA and mRNA approach for obesity treatment using targeting lipid nanoparticles.,"Obesity, a widespread global health issue affecting millions, is characterized by excess fat deposition and metabolic dysfunction, significantly elevating the risk of comorbidities like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, all of which contribute to rising rates of preventable morbidity and mortality. Current approaches to obesity, including lifestyle modifications, and pharmacotherapy, often face limitations such as poor long-term adherence, side effects, and insufficient targeting of the complex, multifactorial pathways underlying the disease. Herein we report a dual, RNA-mediated combinatorial approach using targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for the treatment of obesity. LNPs were co-encapsulated with mRNA encoding Interleukin-27 (mIL-27) to coactivate PGC-1α, PPARα, and UCP-1, thereby promoting adipocyte differentiation and enhancing adaptive thermogenesis within adipocytes, and siRNA targeting Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (siDPP-4) to silence the primary inhibitory enzyme of GLP-1, and GIP within the incretin system, effectively restoring glucose homeostasis. Following post translational silencing of DPP-4 and upregulation of IL-27 in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice model, increased expression of thermogenic biomarkers PGC-1α, PPARα, and UCP-1 was observed at the molecular, protein, and tissue level, and insulin sensitivity was restored. Importantly, this gene modulation led to a 21.1 % reduction of bodyweight after treatment in the DIO model. These findings demonstrate for the first time a dual RNA-mediated combinatorial approach, leveraging liver targeting LNP delivery with synergistic effects from incretin system regulation and induction of adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis after codelivery of siDPP-4 and mIL-27. This innovative strategy provides a promising alternate framework for addressing obesity and its associated metabolic dysfunction.",2025,"['interleukin - 27', 'mil - 27', 'pgc - 1α', 'pparα', 'ucp - 1', 'dipeptidyl peptidase - 4', 'sidpp - 4', 'glp - 1', 'gip', 'incretin', 'dpp - 4', 'il - 27', 'pgc - 1α', 'pparα', 'ucp - 1', 'insulin', 'incretin', 'sidpp - 4', 'mil - 27']","['interleukin 27', 'pparalpha', 'ucp 1', 'dipeptidyl peptidase 4', 'glp 1', 'gip', 'incretin', 'insulin']"
Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Isn't it time to update the terminology?,"There is a paradigm shift in the approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on recent research.

Hence, weight reduction and, whenever possible, achievement of remission has become therapeutic target for the management of T2DM. Increasing evidence suggests that T2DM is a part of the spectrum of diseases caused by excess fat accumulation. Hence, it indeed is the need of the hour to update the terminologies to indicate that T2DM is part of the disease spectrum of excess fat accumulation to improve awareness among healthcare professionals and the public to achieve overall holistic management of the disease spectrum.

Comprehending the Epidemiology and Aetiology of Childhood Obesity: Integrating Life Course Approaches for Prevention and Intervention.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Childhood obesity is defined as a medical condition characterised by abnormally high amounts of body fat relative to lean body mass, which increases the risk of adverse health outcomes among children and adolescents from birth to 18 years. The prevalence of childhood obesity, which has serious healthcare implications, is surging, together with its healthcare burden. In this review we explore the intricate interplay of hereditary, environmental, behavioural, cultural and metabolic factors contributing to the global increase in childhood obesity rates. We examine the influence of prenatal factors, genetic predispositions and epigenetic mechanisms on obesity susceptibility and treatment strategies, emphasising the importance of a multilevel life course framework to understand the multifactorial causes of obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>This narrative review examines the epidemiology, burden, aetiology and impact of childhood obesity by focusing on published literature and the efficacy of multilevel interventions. Comprehensive algorithms are provided to illustrate the causes of childhood obesity through the lens of a multilevel life course framework, taking into consideration individual, family, community and societal factors.<h4>Results</h4>Genetic predispositions, including inherited tendencies towards emotional eating, metabolic variations and body fat distribution, significantly influence a child's obesity risk. Environmental factors, such as limited access to nutritious food, sedentary behaviour, insufficient opportunities for physical activity and obesogenic environments, contribute to the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity. Prenatal influences, including maternal hyperglycaemia and nutritional exposures, lead to epigenetic alterations that predispose children to obesity and metabolic disorders. The social environment, including parental influences, cultural norms and peer dynamics, shapes children's dietary habits and physical activity levels. Additionally, the review highlights the importance of early detection of metabolic alterations associated with paediatric obesity and insulin resistance and the potential for epigenetic mechanisms as therapeutic targets. Recommendations are made for tailored medical nutrition therapy, screening for syndromic obesity and multilevel interventions targeting individual and societal factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review underscores the necessity of a comprehensive, multilevel approach that integrates genetic, environmental, behavioural and cultural factors along with lifestyle modifications and public health initiatives to address the complex and multifaceted issue of childhood obesity effectively. Targeted interventions across the life course, policy reforms, community engagement and technological innovations are recommended to mitigate obesity risks and promote long-term health.

Leptin and Acute Lung Disorders.,"Leptin, an adipokine primarily produced in white adipose tissue, plays a crucial role in metabolism, immunity, and inflammation. Originally identified as a satiety hormone, leptin is also synthesized in various tissues, including the lungs, where it regulates immune responses by binding to the ObR receptor and activating pathways like JAK-STAT3 and PI3K. Functioning as a cytokine-like hormone, leptin modulates innate and adaptive immunity by promoting T and B cell proliferation, macrophage activation, and chemokine secretion. In lung physiology, leptin contributes to maturation and alveolar development, but its role in acute lung disorders such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains controversial. The ""obesity paradox"" suggests that obese patients may be protected against ARDS, potentially due to hyperleptinemia-driven immune modulation, enhanced neutrophil recruitment, and improved alveolar macrophage function. However, obesity-induced leptin resistance may impair these protective effects. Conflicting animal studies on leptin's role in acute lung injury (ALI) further complicate its understanding, with some showing protection and others increased susceptibility to lung damage. Further research is needed to clarify leptin's influence on lung inflammation and its interplay with metabolic disorders like obesity, which could inform targeted therapeutic strategies for ARDS and other pulmonary diseases.",2025,"['leptin', 'leptin', 'obr receptor', 'jak', 'stat3', 'pi3k', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leptin']","['leptin', 'jak', 'stat3', 'pi3k']"

Acidosis is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and incident type 2 diabetes in indigenous Americans: A prospective cohort study.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Whether markers of acid accumulation [decreased plasma bicarbonate, increased anion gap (AG) and corrected anion gap (CAG)] are associated with insulin sensitivity and alter diabetes risk is unclear. We aimed to examine the association of these markers with the gold-standard measure of insulin sensitivity and incident type 2 diabetes.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Healthy adults without diabetes enrolled in a longitudinal study had baseline measures of acidosis (bicarbonate, AG, CAG), insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, and body composition. In cross-sectional analysis (n = 296, 188 male), the relationship between acid markers and insulin sensitivity (M-low) was evaluated. Progression to type 2 diabetes was evaluated by Cox regression models (per 1-SD change) in those with appropriate follow-up visits (n = 233).<h4>Results</h4>Increased AG and CAG were associated with lower M-low, adjusting for age, sex, body fat (%) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (AG: partial r = -0.22, CAG: partial r = -0.24, both p < 0.0001) but not with bicarbonate. During a median follow-up time of 8.0 years, 50 participants developed type 2 diabetes. CAG was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HR: 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.74, p = 0.044) in a model adjusted for age, sex, body fat (%) and baseline plasma glucose, but not after further adjusting for M-low (p = 0.17). Bicarbonate and AG were not associated with risk of diabetes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Acidosis was associated with lower insulin sensitivity and increased risk of type 2 diabetes that was attenuated by measures of lower insulin sensitivity. Acidosis as reflected by CAG may be a target for intervention.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
"Designing, Developing, and Evaluating a Stakeholder-Informed Mobile App to Promote Physical Activity in Children.","<b>Background</b>: Prolonged sedentary behavior and associated obesity are recognized risk factors for poor health across the lifespan. Globally, data show that many children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 significantly increased their sedentary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, failing to meet recommended physical activity levels and reporting increased smartphone use. While mobile devices and video games have been traditionally linked to physical inactivity, formats like exergaming, which combine gameplay with gross motor activity, offer potential to promote physical activity. However, many digital health tools for children are developed without incorporating feedback from key stakeholders and end-users (e.g., children, teachers, and guardians). Therefore, this paper, within the Walk around the Earth (E-Walk) project, describes a prospective study that aims (1) to identify the most influential factors or characteristics affecting engagement with and usability of a mobile application promoting physical activity among primary school students; (2) to develop a mobile application for children based on the identified factors and characteristics. <b>Methods</b>: This project will use a group concept mapping approach to identify the most influential features/factors/characteristics affecting engagement with and usability of an app. By involving primary stakeholders (e.g., children, teachers, guardians, and physical activity experts), the project seeks to align the app's features with primary end-user needs and motivations. Following the app's development, its effectiveness in increasing physical activity levels and reducing sedentary behaviors will be evaluated through a mixed-method design, incorporating anthropometric data, validated physical activity questionnaires (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)), and engagement metrics. <b>Conclusions</b>: The E-Walk project integrates participatory design with educational content and activity-based challenges, representing a multidimensional strategy for promoting health and learning in primary school students. Ultimately, this study contributes to the development of user-informed digital interventions that support sustainable behavioral changes, in line with broader goals of child well-being and digital health promotion.",2025,[],[]
Optimizing Body Composition During Weight Loss: The Role of Amino Acid Supplementation.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Weight loss interventions in individuals with overweight or obesity result in reductions in both fat mass and lean body mass (LBM). While fat loss is the primary therapeutic target, preserving LBM may have favorable health implications. This narrative review evaluates the role of amino acid supplementation, including essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), in supporting the preservation of LBM during weight loss induced by lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, or bariatric surgery. <b>Methods:</b> This is a narrative review of preclinical and clinical studies examining the effects of amino acid supplementation during calorie restriction on body composition and, when available, functional outcomes. A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. <b>Results:</b> Evidence suggests that EAA and peptide-based supplementation may help preserve LBM during periods of reduced energy intake, particularly when protein intake from whole foods is limited. Benefits appear more consistent when supplementation is combined with resistance exercise. BCAA supplementation alone has shown variable effects, especially in sedentary individuals or when total protein intake is already sufficient. Anabolic resistance associated with obesity may attenuate the muscle protein synthesis response to dietary amino acids. <b>Conclusions:</b> Amino acid supplementation may support the maintenance of LBM during weight loss, particularly under conditions of low protein intake or in conjunction with exercise. Further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of LBM changes and identify optimal supplementation strategies.",2025,[],[]

Here, through systematic anti-inflammatory screening, we elucidated both the therapeutic efficacy and mechanistic basis of a novel indole-substituted acetamide derivative (compound #3) in mitigating obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.<h4>Methods</h4>A high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model was used to evaluate the cardioprotective efficacy of compound #3. Integrated in vivo and in vitro studies, including transcriptomics, reverse molecular docking, proteomics, surface plasmon resonance, and kinase activity assays, were conducted to systematically identify molecular targets and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.<h4>Results</h4>Compound #3 attenuated hypertension in HFD-induced obese mice without altering metabolic parameters (body weight, blood glucose, and lipid levels). This cardioprotective effect was attributed to improved cardiac function and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, including the suppression of NF-κB-driven inflammatory injury. Mechanistic studies revealed that compound #3 targeted the L348 residue of ADAM17, disrupting ADAM17-dependent inflammatory signal amplification. This cascade was primarily initiated by the MD2-P38MAPK/JNK-iRhom2 axis. In addition, compound #3 directly bound to MD2, inhibiting palmitic acid (PA)-induced activation of P38MAPK and JNK. This mechanism blocked the initiation of inflammatory responses and further suppressed ADAM17 and cytokine transcription through the P38MAPK-AP1 axis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Compound #3 exhibits a dual-targeting mechanism by simultaneously inhibiting MD2 and ADAM17, which effectively suppresses both the initiation (via the MD2-P38MAPK/JNK) and amplification (via the P38MAPK/JNK-iRhom2-ADAM17 axis) of inflammatory cascades, highlighting its strong therapeutic promise for treating saturated fatty acid-induced myocardial pathologies.",2025,"['nf - κb', 'adam17', 'adam17', 'md2', 'p38', '##mapk', 'jnk', 'irhom2', 'md2', 'p38', '##mapk', 'jnk', 'adam17', 'p38', '##mapk', 'ap1', 'md2', 'adam17', 'md2', 'p38', '##mapk', 'jnk', 'p38', '##mapk', 'jnk', 'irhom2', 'adam17']","['adam17', 'md2', 'p38', 'jnk', 'irhom2', 'ap1']"
Molecular mechanisms and neural mediators of leptin action.,"The adipose-derived hormone leptin signals the adequacy of body triglyceride stores to specialized leptin receptor (LepRb)-containing cells, which modulate physiology and behavior appropriately for the status of energy reserves. Decreased leptin action initiates a program that restrains a host of energy-intensive processes, promotes food seeking and consumption, and supports the continued availability of glucose and other metabolic fuels in the face of diminished fat stores. In addition to activating the STAT3-dependent transcriptional regulation that mediates most leptin action in vivo, LepRb mediates some leptin effects via a poorly understood second intracellular signaling pathway. Leptin also activates feedback pathways that restrain LepRb signaling in the face of high leptin, as in obesity. Leptin mediates most of its metabolic effects via multiple populations of <i>Lepr</i>-expressing hypothalamic neurons, each of which controls different aspects of leptin action. Although most of these neuron populations contribute only modestly to the control of food intake and body weight by leptin, <i>Glp1r</i>-expressing <i>Lepr</i> neurons inhibit <i>Agrp</i> neurons and strongly suppress feeding and body weight. Going forward, it will be important to define the potentially distinct intracellular responses to leptin for individual <i>Lepr</i> neuron populations, along with the cell type-specific roles for these responses in the physiologic effects of leptin.",2025,"['leptin', 'leptin receptor', 'leprb', 'leptin', 'stat3', 'leptin', 'leprb', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'leprb', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'leptin', 'glp1r', 'lepr', 'agrp', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin']","['leptin', 'leptin receptor', 'stat3', 'lepr', 'glp1r', 'agrp']"
"Recent advances in targeting obesity, with a focus on TGF-β signaling and vagus nerve innervation.","Over a third of the global population is affected by obesity, fatty liver disease (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease, MASLD), and its severe form, MASH (Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis), which can ultimately progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent advancements include therapeutics such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists and neural/vagal modulation strategies for these disorders. Among the many pathways regulating these conditions, emerging insights into transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling highlight potential future targets through its role in pathophysiological processes such as adipogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Vagus nerve innervation in the gastrointestinal tract is involved in satiety regulation and energy homeostasis, and vagus nerve stimulation has been applied in weight loss and diabetes.

Metallothioneins in the Pathogenesis of Liver Diseases: A Review.,"Metallothioneins (MTs) are primarily known for maintaining cellular metal homeostasis and protecting against metal toxicity, but they also play critical roles in mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. Reduced MTs expression is associated with disease progression in several chronic hepatic disorders. In metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MT1 downregulation has been linked to the transition from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Additionally, evidence suggests that individuals with low MTs expression may be more susceptible to obesity, which is one of the key drivers in the development of MASLD. In chronic viral hepatitis, in vivo MTs downregulation contrasts with acute-phase in vitro upregulation, suggesting an effect of persistent inflammation. MTs downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates with poor prognosis, positioning MTs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In contrast, increased MTs expression may play a protective or diagnostically informative role in other conditions. In alcoholic hepatitis, MT1 overexpression contributes to defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. In Wilson's disease, MTs demonstrates prominent hepatic expression and may offer diagnostic value alongside traditional markers such as rhodanine staining. In cholestatic liver diseases like PBC and PSC, MTs expression correlates with disease progression. This review highlights the emerging role of MTs in liver disease pathogenesis and positions them as promising molecular tools that may inform future strategies for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of liver diseases.",2025,"['metallothioneins', 'mts', 'mts', 'mt1', 'mts', 'mts', 'mts', 'mts', 'mts', 'mt1', 'mts', 'mts', 'mts']","['metallothionein', 'mt1']"
Natural bioactive compounds and their mechanisms of action in the management of obesity: a narrative review.,"Obesity is a burning public health problem that affects both children and adult population all over the world. The incidence of obesity will increase in the coming years due to the urbanization of societies, which has led to unbalanced food intake and lack of physical activity among individuals. The efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions is limited, and a large number of drugs are known to trigger side effects, leading to their removal from the market. The use of natural products that exert least significant side effects can be a good alternative to prevent and manage obesity and its associated complications. These natural products include polyphenols, carotenoids and alkaloids that are recognized for their extensive range of biomedical applications and have been in practice for several decades. Administering low-to-moderate doses can yield a number of health benefits; thereby, enhancing their utility in clinical settings. Nevertheless, their direct application poses challenges due to several issues such as low bioavailability, scalability, environmental impact, clinical inconsistency, and toxicity at high doses. This review seeks to examine and identify the effects of some natural bioactive compounds (NBCs) in the management of obesity by targeting pathophysiological pathways, discuss the challenges associated with the use of NBCs including issues of bioavailability, dosage, toxicity and analysis of the efficacy of polyphenols in different models. It is necessary of address challenges associated with the use of NBCs by developing formulation strategies, establishing a safe concentration margin, employing humanized <i>in vitro</i> models to enhance translatability to clinical applications, optimizing dosage and harmonizing guidelines. The review also focuses on some conclusive studies demonstrating the potential anti-obesity effects of the most studied bioactive compounds <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and in clinical human trials through the regulation of appetite, adipogenesis, inflammation, thermogenesis and energy expenditure and gut microbiome.",2025,[],[]
"Physiological Conditions, Bioactive Ingredients, and Drugs Stimulating Non-Shivering Thermogenesis as a Promising Treatment Against Diabesity.","Obesity (lipotoxicity) results from a chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. It is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, glucotoxicity) and considered a major risk factor for the development of metabolic complications. Their convergence constitutes ""diabesity"", representing a major challenge for public health worldwide. Limited treatment efficacy highlights the need for novel, multi-targeted therapies. Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), mediated by brown and beige adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, has emerged as a promising therapy due to its capacity to increase energy expenditure and improve metabolic health. Also, skeletal muscle plays a central role in glucose uptake and lipid oxidation, further highlighting its relevance in diabesity. This review explores current and emerging knowledge on physiological stimuli, including cold exposure, physical activity, and fasting, as well as bioactive ingredients and drugs that stimulate NST in thermogenic tissues. Special emphasis is placed on melatonin as a potential regulator of mitochondrial function and energy balance. The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on scientific relevance, novelty, and mechanistic insight; prioritizing human and high-quality rodent research published in peer-reviewed journals. Evidence shows that multiple interventions enhance NST, leading to improved glucose metabolism, reduced fat accumulation, and increased energy expenditure in humans and/or rodents. Melatonin, in particular, shows promise in modulating thermogenesis through organelle-molecular pathways and mitochondrial protective effects. In conclusion, a multi-target approach through the activation of NST by physiological, nutritional, and pharmacological agents offers an effective and safe treatment for diabesity. Further research is needed to confirm these effects in clinical practice and support their use as effective therapeutic strategies.",2025,['n'],[]
Sotagliflozin provides additional benefits for high-fat diet-induced cardiac inflammatory injury by extra inhibiting P38MAPK and JNK.,"SGLT1/2 dual-target inhibitors have demonstrated significant benefits for diabetic patients, particularly those with cardiovascular complications. However, pharmacological mechanisms beyond SGLT1/2 inhibition remain incompletely understood. The current study investigated the effects of sotagliflozin, a representative SGLT1/2 inhibitor, on obesity-related cardiomyopathy and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. A high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model was employed to evaluate cardiac function and biochemical parameters, complemented by transcriptomic analysis and network pharmacology to identify potential therapeutic targets. Results demonstrated that sotagliflozin effectively ameliorated hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in obese mice while significantly improving obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction through suppression of myocardial inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the MAPK pathway, which was further corroborated by network pharmacology. Both in vivo and in vitro validation confirmed direct binding of sotagliflozin to P38MAPK and JNK, leading to significant inhibition of their activation induced by palmitic acid or high-fat diet. These findings suggest that the cardioprotective effects of sotagliflozin against obesity-related cardiomyopathy are mediated through multi-target inhibition of P38MAPK and JNK pathways. Targeting inflammatory signaling pathways while managing cardiovascular risk factors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated cardiovascular diseases.",2025,"['sglt1 / 2', 'sglt1 / 2', 's', '##glt1 / 2', 'map', 'p38mapk', 'jnk', 'p38', '##pk', 'jnk']","['map', 'p38mapk', 'jnk', 'p38']"
Trends and Inequalities of Co-Occurring Obesity and Elevated Blood Pressure Among Chinese Children and Adolescents Aged 7-18 Years from 1985 to 2019 and Projections to 2030.,"<b>Background</b>: The co-occurrence of obesity and elevated blood pressure (EBP) in childhood represents a critical but underrecognized public health concern, with potential long-term consequences for cardiometabolic health. Understanding its trends and disparities is essential for early prevention strategies. <b>Methods</b>: This study analyzed data from 1,692,660 Han Chinese children and adolescents aged 7-18 years collected across seven waves of the Chinese National Survey on Students' Constitution and Health (CNSSCH) from 1985 to 2019. Joinpoint regression was used to estimate temporal trends, and logistic generalized additive models were fitted to predict prevalence through 2030. <b>Results</b>: The prevalence of co-occurring obesity and EBP increased from 0.06% in 1985 to 2.36% in 2019 and is projected to reach 5.87% by 2030. A slowdown in the growth rate was observed approximately in 2000. Notably, rural areas experienced a faster and more recent rise, especially among girls, suggesting widening disparities. <b>Conclusions</b>: The growing dual burden of obesity and EBP in Chinese youth, especially in rural areas, calls for urgent and integrated interventions. Public health efforts must prioritize early prevention, with equitable policies that engage schools, families, and communities, particularly in underserved populations.",2025,[],[]

"Fatty Acid Profile and Desaturase Activity in Obesity: Roles, Mechanisms, and Clinical Relevance.","<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a complex metabolic disease associated with several health complications, including insulin resistance, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Growing evidence indicates that fatty acid profiles and the activity of desaturating enzymes-stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 desaturase (D5D), and delta-6 desaturase (D6D)-are important factors in the pathophysiology of obesity. This review aims to summarise the current understanding of the alterations in lipid metabolism and desaturase activity in obesity, its complications, and potential therapeutic interventions.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature review was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies, cross-sectional studies, and animal studies that assessed fatty acid profiles and desaturase activity in the context of obesity were included.<h4>Results</h4>Obesity is associated with significant changes in the profiles of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as altered desaturase activity. Increased activity of SCD1 and D6D and decreased activity of D5D are observed even in childhood and correlate with metabolic risk markers. Genetic variation in genes encoding fatty acid desaturases, such as fatty acid desaturase 1 (<i>FADS1)</i>, fatty acid desaturase 2 (<i>FADS2)</i>, and <i>SCD1</i>, influences lipid metabolism and susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Nutritional interventions, supplementation (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, L-carnitine, and crocin), physical activity, and bariatric surgery positively influence the fatty acid profile and enzymatic activity, modifying the risk of obesity-related diseases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Fatty acid profile and desaturase activity are significantly altered in obesity and represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for its treatment and the prevention of related complications.

"Phosphatidic Acid Reverses Obesity Induced by a High-Fat, High-Sugar Diet at the Transcriptional Level.","<b>Background:</b> Obesity poses a significant threat to human health and is commonly caused by excessive dietary intake. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is one of the simplest diacylglycerol phospholipids, serving as a crucial precursor for the synthesis of triglycerides and other complex phospholipids. PA is also an important intermediate product in the process of fat digestion and absorption. Studies have shown that PA has muscle-building and fat-reducing effects, but it is currently unclear whether it can combat obesity induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFD). <b>Methods:</b> Using a model of obesity induced by a high-fat high-sugar diet, we found that the addition of PA to food could reverse HFD-induced obesity. <b>Results:</b> Addition of PA to food can reverse obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Transcriptomic analysis results indicate that this reversal also takes place at the molecular level. Further analysis suggests that PA may regulate fat metabolism by reversing the PPAR signaling pathway. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study provides molecular evidence for the use of PA as an effective additive in weight-loss food products.",2025,[],[]
Adipose tissue dysfunction disrupts metabolic homeostasis: mechanisms linking fat dysregulation to disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metabolic disease incidence continues rising globally. Adipose tissue dysfunction serves as a crucial pathophysiological mediator. We evaluate molecular mechanisms linking adipose dysfunction to metabolic dysregulation.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically reviewed literature on adipose biology, stress mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic networks. Analysis prioritized methodologically robust studies from the past decade.<h4>Results</h4>Adipose dysfunction disrupts metabolic homeostasis through complex molecular networks. Stressed adipocytes exhibit mitochondrial impairment and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These changes alter inflammatory mediators and adipokine secretion. Brown and beige adipose regulate energy balance via uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. Key transcriptional regulators, PGC-1α and PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), control thermogenic adipocyte development. Cellular senescence contributes significantly to age-related adipose dysfunction through inflammatory secretory phenotypes. Brown fat also secretes specialized factors influencing whole-body metabolism, emphasizing adipose tissue's endocrine function.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Adipose dysfunction represents a critical nexus in metabolic disease pathogenesis. Cellular stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation converge at this point. Novel therapies targeting thermogenic activation and cellular senescence show promise. Despite advancing mechanistic understanding, developing effective interventions remains challenging due to adipose tissue's complex roles in systemic metabolic regulation.",2025,"['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'pgc - 1α', 'pr domain containing 16', 'prdm16']","['uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'prdm16']"

"The Role of Binge Eating in a Sequential Mediation Model of Stress, Emotional Eating, and BMI.","<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Chronic stress contributes to obesity through maladaptive eating behaviors, including emotional eating (eating due to negative emotions) and binge eating (consuming large amounts of food with a loss of control). A theoretical model suggests that emotional eating can escalate to binge eating along a severity continuum, but this sequential pathway from stress to higher body mass index (BMI) has remained empirically untested. Therefore, this study examined a serial mediation model in which perceived stress predicts BMI sequentially through emotional eating and then binge eating. <b>Methods:</b> In this cross-sectional study, 272 Korean adults completed the Perceived Stress Scale, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (emotional eating subscale), and the Binge Eating Scale. The serial mediation model was tested using PROCESS macro model 6, with age, gender, and education as covariates. <b>Results:</b> The serial mediation pathway (stress → emotional eating → binge eating → BMI) was statistically significant (indirect effect <i>B</i> = 0.071, 95% CI [0.041, 0.112]). A separate simple mediation path through binge eating alone was also significant (B = 0.056, 95% CI [0.018, 0.102]), whereas the path through emotional eating alone was not significant. The total indirect effect (B = 0.108, 95% CI [0.052, 0.172]) was significant, indicating that the influence of stress on BMI was fully mediated by the eating behaviors modeled. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides the first empirical evidence supporting a sequential pathway from stress to elevated BMI via the progression from emotional to binge eating. The findings support the overeating continuum model and highlight binge eating as a pivotal mediator. This behavioral progression suggests that emotional and binge eating are distinct stages, offering crucial opportunities for tailored prevention and intervention.",2025,[],[]
Lipin-1 Drives Browning of White Adipocytes via Promotion of Brown Phenotype Markers.,"<b>Background:</b> Enhancing adipose tissue functionality is a promising cellular-level approach to combating obesity. White adipose tissue (WAT) can acquire beige or brown adipose tissue (BAT)-like properties, characterized by increased thermogenesis and energy dissipation. While the SIRT1-SRSF10-Lipin-1 axis has been identified in hepatocytes, where Lipin-1 regulates triglyceride metabolism, its role in adipocytes remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of Lipin-1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and its interaction with SIRT1, SRSF10, and PPARγ in promoting browning-like transcriptional responses. <b>Methods:</b> Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated during differentiation with either rosiglitazone (RGZ), the SIRT1 activator SRT1720, or the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR, and protein levels were measured using the Simple Western blot system. Data were compared with untreated controls and analyzed using GraphPad Prism. <b>Results:</b> Lipin-1 expression was significantly upregulated by RGZ treatment, alongside increased transcription of Sirt1 and Srsf10, supporting the presence of this regulatory axis in adipocytes. Elevated Srsf10 favored the production of the Lipin-1b isoform, whereas SIRT1 inhibition reversed these effects, confirming its upstream role. Pathway activation further enhanced the expression of browning markers, including Ucp1, Pgc1a, PRDM16, and CIDEA. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings demonstrate that Lipin-1 interacts with the SIRT1-PPARγ-SRSF10 axis in adipocytes and contributes to the acquisition of beige/brown-like characteristics in WAT.

The Gut Microbiome in Human Obesity: A Comprehensive Review.,"An estimated 2.6 billion individuals are currently living with overweight or obesity, and this number is projected to exceed 4 billion by 2035. Consequently, unless this increasing trajectory is effectively addressed, the trend is expected to continue in the coming years. The gut microbiome has emerged as a central regulator of host metabolism and energy homeostasis, making its detailed characterization crucial for the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies and for elucidating mechanisms underlying metabolic health and disease. This review examines human obesity through the lens of the gut microbiome, providing a comprehensive overview of its role by addressing gut microbiome alterations, microbiome-driven mechanisms, dietary influences, prebiotic effects, microbiome-based therapeutics, and other approaches in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The composition of the gut microbiome is altered in obesity and characterized by reduced microbial diversity and inconsistent shifts in dominant bacterial phyla, which collectively contribute to metabolic dysregulation. The gut microbiome influences obesity through multiple mechanisms. These include regulating energy balance and insulin sensitivity via short-chain fatty acids, inducing chronic inflammation, modulating metabolic and appetite genes, altering bile acid signaling, and promoting fat storage by inhibiting fasting-induced adipose factor. Dietary patterns exert a profound influence on gut microbiome composition and function, with plant-based diets conferring protective effects against obesity and its comorbidities. Microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have demonstrated potential in modulating key metabolic and inflammatory pathways associated with obesity. As the scientific understanding of the human gut microbiome continues to advance, the integration of microbiome-based therapies into standard clinical practice is poised to become increasingly feasible and therapeutically transformative, particularly for obesity, a complex condition that demands innovative and customized interventions.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Inflammasomes: novel therapeutic targets for metabolic syndrome?,"Chronic inflammation is a hallmark for Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). It is also one of the most important risk factors for insulin resistance and metabolic disorders.

A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammasomes play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology and progression of metabolic diseases, as deficiency in the key component of inflammasomes protects mice from high fat diet induced obesity and insulin resistance. Thus, in this review, we will summarize the role of inflammasomes in MetS and how to treat MetS by targeting inflammasomes.

Regulation of Metabolic Aging Through Adenosine Mono Phosphate-Activated Protein Kinase and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin: A Comparative Study of Intermittent Fasting Variations in Obese Young Women.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Obesity accelerates metabolic aging through oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are nutrient-sensing pathways regulating metabolism. AMPK promotes energy metabolism and autophagy, while excessive mTOR activity contributes to aging. Intermittent fasting (IF), including time-restricted feeding (TRF)-limiting food intake to a 6 h window (18:6)-and alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF)-alternating 24 h fasting (≤25% daily caloric intake) with unrestricted feeding-may improve metabolic regulation. However, their effects on AMPK, mTOR, and metabolic age remain unclear. <b>Methods:</b> This quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test control group study compared the TRF and ADMF on metabolic age, AMPK, and mTOR in young obese women. Twenty-four participants (mean age: 21.29 ± 1.76 years; body fat: 36.92 ± 3.18%; BMI: 29.68 ± 3.70 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were initially matched by BMI and assigned to Control, TRF, and ADMF groups. A total of 4 participants (1 Control, 3 ADMF) were excluded due to outlier values, yielding final group sizes: Control (<i>n</i> = 7), TRF (<i>n</i> = 8), and ADMF (<i>n</i> = 5). The intervention lasted 20 days. <b>Results</b>: A significant decrease in AMPK levels was observed in the ADMF group (<i>p</i> = 0.043), while changes in the TRF and Control groups were not significant. mTOR levels showed a decreasing trend but were not statistically significant. No significant changes were found in metabolic age. <b>Conclusions:</b> Twenty days of intermittent fasting intervention did not significantly affect AMPK, mTOR, or metabolic age in young obese women.

Evaluation of a Smartphone-Based Weight Loss Intervention with Telephone Support for Merchant Women With Obesity in Côte d'Ivoire: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>The obesity rate among women in Côte d'Ivoire is rising, particularly in urban areas. Merchantry is the leading occupation for women in the country, and merchant women face a high risk of obesity owing to their sedentary lifestyle. A previous survey indicated that the obesity rate among merchant women was 30%, double the national average. Furthermore, 82.2% of merchant women with obesity were unaware of their condition, and 40.1% expressed no interest in losing weight. While most weight loss programs target individuals ready to lose weight, community interventions should also address those with minimal readiness. Additionally, low-cost weight-loss interventions that do not require health professionals are needed in countries with limited medical resources. Smartphones could offer a cost-effective solution as they enable self-monitoring and remote communication.<h4>Objective</h4>This study will evaluate a low-cost smartphone-based intervention that targets individuals who are not ready to lose weight without the involvement of health professionals.<h4>Methods</h4>The intervention will run for 6 months, and its efficacy will be assessed in an unblinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with 108 participants per group. All direct interventions for participants in this study will be carried out by staff without medical qualifications. The intervention group will receive weighing scales and be encouraged to record their weight with a smartphone app. Health education will be provided via weekly group messages and monthly phone calls. The evaluation will be conducted face-to-face. The primary outcome will be the weight change, and the secondary outcome will be differences in body fat percentage, abdominal circumference, and stage of behavioral change in weight loss behaviors from baseline to 3, 6, and 12 months.<h4>Results</h4>In accordance with this protocol, the recruitment of participants started on August 26, 2024. A total of 216 participants were allocated, with 108 in the intervention group and 108 in the control group. The baseline survey began on November 15, 2024, and is currently ongoing as of the end of November 2024.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study will be the first in sub-Saharan African countries to implement a smartphone app-based weight loss program in sub-Saharan Africa that does not require direct intervention by health care professionals but specifically targets communities. Furthermore, if the effectiveness of this program is confirmed, it has the potential to serve as a low-cost sustainable weight loss model at the policy level.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/69264.",2025,[],[]
Spatial patterns of childhood obesity clusters linked to socioeconomic inequalities.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The childhood obesity epidemic continues to be a challenge worldwide despite advances in prevention and treatment. Multifactorial causes are responsible for this epidemiology, and unequivocally, environmental factors play a key role. Studying the connection between socioeconomic factors and prevalence of childhood obesity is key to instituting change on a public health level.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify geographical areas (clusters) with high and low prevalence of childhood obesity and examine their spatial association with socio-economic and demographic factors.<h4>Methods</h4>Cluster analysis of geographic and population data for localities and regional councils was performed using growth data for children in grade 1. Analysis of childhood obesity prevalence utilized spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) and Getis-Ord Gi∗ statistic (hotspot analysis). Local Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR) were performed to examine socio-economic and demographic predictors of the z-score values from the hotspot analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The cluster analysis identified several significant spatial clusters of localities with high and low z-scores from the Getis-Ord Gi∗ hotspot analysis. Both the GWR and MGWR models demonstrated notable spatial variation, achieving high adjusted R-squared values (95.2 and 96.4%, respectively) and low residual variances (0.05 and 0.03, respectively). The analysis indicated that the variables exhibited a significant localized effect (<i>p</i> < 0.05), underscoring spatial heterogeneity. Among these variables, three showed a significant influence across the entire geographic area: average years of education for individuals aged 25-54, the percentage of families with four or more children, and the socioeconomic index. These findings emphasize the spatial variability of these factors and the ability of the model to generate a range of coefficients tailored to each locality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The application of geographic techniques enables examination of spatial patterns of childhood obesity. The current analysis is the first study that demonstrate a direct association between cluster areas of childhood obesity prevalence and socio-economic and demographic factors in the Middle East. It highlights that spatial dependence and heterogeneity are key factors in analyzing patterns of childhood obesity. Correlations between sociodemographic parameters are consistent with patterns observed in high-income countries (a negative socioeconomic index association) and in middle-and low-income countries (a positive association with average years of schooling). The results suggest that the immediate geographic environment plays a substantial role in childhood obesity. Therefore, it may reflect different patterns related to macroeconomic factors, such as the country's income level.",2025,[],[]
"Evaluation of anesthesia-related videos in patients with obesity on the youtube platform in terms of quality, reliability, and usefulness.","The purpose of this study is to assess the quality, reliability, and usefulness of anesthesia-related YouTube videos for obese patients by analyzing their content and evaluating their usefulness based on the source of the video. This research analyzed the top 108 most-watched YouTube videos tagged with ""bariatric anesthesia"" and ""anesthesia in obese patients."" We recorded data such as the upload year, number of views, days since upload, daily average views, length of videos, and the number of likes and comments. Videos were grouped into 3 categories: healthcare institutions, educational institutions, and personal websites. The accuracy and reliability of the videos were evaluated using standards set by the American Medical Association. The quality was assessed via a global quality scale (GQS), and usefulness was determined through a newly developed obesity anesthesia benefit index (OABI). The general usefulness of these videos was rated low. There was a notable correlation between the OABI usefulness scores and both the video durations and the time since upload (P = .000; P = .037). Videos from educational institutions notably scored higher on the GQS and according to the American Medical Association standards compared to other sources (P < .000; P < .000). Despite these differences, 75% of videos from healthcare institutions, 61.9% from educational institutions, and 76.5% from personal sources were classified as minimally useful according to the OABI. Our evaluation using the obesity anesthesia benefit index revealed that the usefulness of the YouTube videos was lower than initially hypothesized.",2025,[],[]
Integrative analysis of candidate MicroRNAs and gene targets for OSA management using in silico and in-vitro approach.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases including sleep disorders. The aim of this study is to address the involvement of miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-29) in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this study we have done integrated analysis of miRNAs with their potential gene targets as a strategy for management of OSA.<h4>Methods</h4>miRNA expression levels were quantified in healthy control group and obese vs. Non-obese OSA subjects by Quantitative real-time PCR. In-silico analysis of interplay of miRNAs with potential gene targets was done using Schrödinger Release 2023-1.<h4>Results</h4>The real time expression analysis revealed a differential expression pattern in miRNAs indicating down-regulation of miR-21 in obese OSA while miR-29 showed upregulation as compared to non-obese OSA and healthy subjects with p values of ≤0.01 and <0.0001respectively. A trend was observed where target genes TGFBR2, NAMPT, and NPPB were significantly increased with p-value of ≤0.0001 and TGFBR3 and INSIG2 showed decreasing trend with p-value of ≤0.0001 between obese and non-obese OSA respectively. MD simulation analysis provided valuable information regarding the stability, flexibility, compactness and solvent exposure of the complexes over time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>miR-21 and miR-29 possesses differential expressions in obese OSA subject and exihbits strong molecular interactions with potential target genes, such as TGFBR2, NPPB, NAMPT and INSIG2. Identifying the miRNAs, genes and pathways associated with OSA can help to expand our understanding of the risk factors for the disease as well as provide new avenues for potential treatment.",2025,"['mir - 21', 'mir - 29', 'mir - 21', 'mir - 29', 'tgfbr2', 'nampt', 'nppb', 'tgfbr3', '##2', 'mir - 21', 'mir - 29', 'tgfbr2', 'nppb', 'nampt', 'insig2']","['tgfbr2', 'nampt', 'nppb', 'tgfbr3', 'insig2']"
"GIP Receptor Antagonists in the Pharmacotherapy of Obesity: Physiologic, Genetic, and Clinical Rationale.","Obesity is a prevalent disease that also contributes to the incidence and severity of many other chronic diseases and health conditions. Treatment approaches include lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological approaches, with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists approved specifically for weight loss having changed the treatment landscape significantly in the last 5 years. Targeting the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor may enhance the metabolic benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonism. These beneficial effects are seen with both GIP receptor antagonism and GIP receptor agonism, although the mechanisms underlying this apparent paradox remain unknown. Here, we summarize the physiologic, genetic, and clinical evidence for pursuing GIP receptor antagonism to achieve metabolic and weight benefits. Both global and central nervous system knockout of GIP receptors protects mice fed a high-fat diet from obesity and insulin resistance. Genome-wide association studies in humans support this notion, correlating lower BMI with GIP receptor genetic variants with reduced function. Pharmacologic approaches in mice and monkeys confirm that GIP receptor antagonism enhances GLP-1-induced weight reduction and other metabolic benefits, and a phase 1 study provides proof of principle that beneficial effects extend to humans. GIP receptor antagonism may represent an important new mechanism to expand the treatment options available to individuals living with obesity.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( gip ) receptor', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'gip receptor', 'gip receptor', 'gip receptor', 'gip receptors', 'insulin', 'gip receptor genetic variants', 'gip receptor', 'glp - 1', 'gip receptor']","['glp 1 receptor', 'gip receptor', 'insulin', 'glp 1']"
"MicroRNAs in metabolic syndrome: Mechanisms, diagnosis, and therapy.","Metabolic syndrome is a group of cardio-metabolic dysfunctions characterized by increased fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, triglycerides, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Globally, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome ranged from 12.5-31.4 %, among which 5-7 % were young adults. Environmental factors, nutrition, and genetic and epigenetic predispositions are thought to interact intricately to cause metabolic disease. MicroRNAs are short, small non-coding RNAs that attach to the target coding sequences and untranslated genomic regions in many cell types, thereby post-transcriptionally suppressing gene expression. The human genome contains around 2000 microRNAs many of which appear linked to a numerous biologic and pathophysiologic processes, such as inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. Many human disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disorders, have been linked to deregulated microRNA expression. More recently, the identification of extracellular microRNAs has highlighted their potential as markers of disease and endocrine signaling molecules. This review provides an overview of microRNA biogenesis and its function in insulin signaling, adipogenesis, biology of pancreatic β-cell, and metabolism. We review current research on microRNAs linked to vascular diabetic complications and metabolic diseases, with a focus on their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.",2025,"['high - density lipoprotein ch', 'insulin']",['insulin']

Potency of Rosella calyx as a candidate for anti-obesity treatment based on in silico and in vitro studies with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells,"Obesity is a complex medical condition with an increasing global prevalence. It is influenced by various genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors, contributing to higher risks of chronic diseases. The current therapy for obesity uses a multidisciplinary approach, but often leads to undesirable side effects. Therefore, potential natural alternatives such as anti-obesity agents are needed. This study aimed evaluate the potential of Rosella calyx extract in inhibiting adipocyte maturation using in silico and in vitro approaches with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs). The content of Rosella extract compound was identified using GC–MS. An in silico analysis was conducted to predict the potential of the compounds, protein targets, and molecular pathways. Furthermore, the effect of extract on the differentiation of adipocytes from mesenchymal stem cells in the human umbilical cord was evaluated in vitro. The results showed that GC–MS identified four major compounds in Rosella extract, namely Triacetin, Pentadecanol, Phenol, and Propionic Acid. Based on in silico analysis, these compounds have the potential to inhibit adipocyte maturation through interactions with target proteins such as PPARG, LEP, INS, ADIPOQ, SIRT1, and POMC. In vitro studies confirmed that Rosella extract effectively inhibited the differentiation of human umbilical cord stem cell-derived adipocytes at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Rosella calyx extract showed promising anti-obesity effects by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation pathways, primarily targeting PPARγ. These results provide a scientific basis for the development of extract as a potential therapeutic agent in the management of obesity.",2025,"['pparg', 'lep', 'ins', 'adipoq', 'sirt1', 'pomc', 'pparγ']","['pparg', 'lep', 'ins', 'adipoq', 'sirt1', 'pomc', 'pparγ']"
"Tirzepatide for the Maintenance of Body Weight Reduction: Rationale, Design, and Baseline Characteristics of SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN.","<h4>Objective</h4>SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reducing the tirzepatide dose and/or continuing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) versus placebo in maintaining body weight (BW) reduction achieved with tirzepatide MTD.<h4>Methods</h4>This Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 52-week clinical trial is in progress comparing treatment with once weekly tirzepatide (5 mg and/or MTD of 15 mg or 10 mg) versus placebo in achieving BW reduction maintenance from the initial 60-week open-label weight-loss period on tirzepatide MTD, in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or ≥ 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with ≥ 1 obesity-related comorbidity, excluding type 2 diabetes). The primary endpoint is percent maintenance of BW reduction achieved during the weight-loss period at Week 112 among those who reached a BW plateau (i.e., < 5% BW change) between Weeks 48 and 60.<h4>Results</h4>Participants are mostly female (65%) with a mean ± SD age of 47 ± 13 years, BW 114 ± 27 kg, BMI 40 ± 8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and waist circumference 119 ± 18 cm.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN trial will evaluate whether reducing or continuing the tirzepatide dose as a long-term treatment option may help maintain the reduced BW initially achieved with tirzepatide MTD versus switching to placebo. Combined, this study may provide additional evidence to help tailor patient-centered strategies for maintenance of BW reduction in adults living with obesity.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06047548.",2025,[],[]
Endothelial Dysfunction in Adolescent Hypertension: Diagnostic Challenges and Early Cardiovascular Risk.,"Hypertension in adolescence causes early vascular injury manifesting as endothelial dysfunction (ED), which signifies elevated cardiovascular risk. This review synthesizes recent insights (2020-2025) into ED's mechanisms and detection in hypertensive youth. We highlight how reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormonal changes in puberty contribute to ED and consequent vascular remodeling. Non-invasive diagnostic tools (e.g., flow-mediated dilation, peripheral arterial tonometry) reveal that even asymptomatic hypertensive adolescents have measurable ED linked to arterial stiffness and cardiac changes. Encouragingly, ED in youth appears reversible: exercise and dietary interventions improve endothelial function, and pharmacotherapy (ACE inhibitors, ARBs) can restore endothelial health beyond blood pressure control. Early identification of ED in hypertensive adolescents is therefore critical-it not only refines risk stratification (e.g., unmasking high-risk ""white-coat"" hypertension) but also presents an opportunity to initiate lifestyle modifications and therapy to preserve vascular function.",2025,['ace'],['ace']
Adipose Progenitor Cells in Thermogenesis and Metabolic Regulation.,"Thermogenic adipose tissues, including brown and beige, exhibit remarkable cellular and metabolic adaptations to environmental and physiological cues, contributing to improved metabolic health. Among these adaptations, adipose progenitor cells (APCs), a heterogeneous cell population comprising distinct subsets, play a crucial role in generating thermogenic adipocytes and promoting healthy adipose tissue remodeling and metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, targeting APCs offers a potential therapeutic approach for regulating adipose plasticity and remodeling to address metabolic dysregulation. The precise identity of APCs and the roles of specific APC subtypes in metabolic regulation and diseases remain to be elucidated. Here, we summarize recent findings on the lineage of APCs that give rise to thermogenic adipocytes and how environmental conditions regulate their proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we discuss the potential of targeting APCs as an alternative therapeutic strategy to combat metabolic diseases.",2025,[],[]
Early-Life Hydrogen Sulfide Signaling as a Target for Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Syndrome Reprogramming.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), once regarded solely as a toxic gas, is now recognized as a vital endogenous signaling molecule with important roles in both health and disease. Growing evidence supports the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) framework, in which early-life disturbances in H<sub>2</sub>S signaling may drive the later development of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome-a condition that encompasses chronic kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This review highlights the emerging importance of H<sub>2</sub>S in CKM programming and the potential of H<sub>2</sub>S-based interventions during gestation and lactation to prevent long-term adverse health outcomes in offspring. Findings from animal studies suggest that maternal supplementation with sulfur-containing amino acids, <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine, H<sub>2</sub>S donors, and related sulfur-containing biomolecules can attenuate CKM-related risks in progeny. Despite these advances, several critical areas remain underexplored, including the role of gut microbiota-derived H<sub>2</sub>S, the epigenetic mechanisms influenced by H<sub>2</sub>S during development, and the clinical translation of preclinical findings. Targeting H<sub>2</sub>S signaling offers a promising strategy for early-life prevention of CKM syndrome and may also hold broader potential for preventing other DOHaD-related chronic diseases.",2025,[],[]
"""PrevenganT2,"" a Culturally Responsive Family-Based Diabetes Prevention Intervention for Hispanic or Latino Adults at High Risk for Type 2 Diabetes: Protocol for a Proof-of-Concept Evaluation.","<h4>Background</h4>Despite the efficacy of lifestyle interventions for preventing or delaying diabetes, community translations to date have failed to engage Hispanic or Latino participants effectively. Previously identified barriers to engagement include lack of family support and the burden of time-intensive year-long programs. Integrating family members and reducing program length may have the potential to increase engagement in lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes in Hispanic or Latino individuals.<h4>Objective</h4>Given the potential impact of cultural adaptation on such interventions, our community-academic research team used the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model to guide an adaptation of the core 16 modules of the National Diabetes Prevention Program's PrevengaT2 curriculum to meet the needs of Hispanic or Latino communities in Utah. We describe our evaluation of this adaptation in an ongoing proof-of-concept trial. We will evaluate whether Hispanic or Latino participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes increase their weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in the context of an ongoing proof-of-concept trial of the adaptation.<h4>Methods</h4>Target participants at risk for type 2 diabetes and a family member were invited to participate in PrevenganT2. In earlier phases of a larger project, our academic-community research team created the 14-week lifestyle intervention by adapting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's PrevengaT2 curriculum. Objective MVPA was measured for 7 days at preintervention and postintervention using ActiGraph GT3X-BT accelerometers. Participants additionally completed questionnaires at preintervention and postintervention, and weight and self-reported MVPA were recorded at lifestyle intervention classes. Physical activity data will be analyzed to determine the percentage of target participants with clinically significant pre-post increases in MVPA.<h4>Results</h4>Data collection concluded in October 2024. Data cleaning and preparation for analysis are ongoing. We expect that results will be submitted for publication by June 2025.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study serves as a first step in evaluating a novel, culturally adapted lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes in Hispanic or Latino adults. Although this small study is not without limitations, findings will inform our team's next steps for this early-phase intervention work.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/66317.",2025,[],[]
The new definition of obesity: an analysis of a population-based survey in an Andean country.,"<h4>Background</h4>Traditional obesity classification based on body mass index (BMI) fails to capture body fat distribution or clinical dysfunction, and may therefore fail to identify people at highest cardiometabolic risk. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology Commission recently proposed a new framework distinguishing preclinical from clinical obesity based on excessive adiposity and clinical dysfunction. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of clinical and preclinical obesity in Peruvian adults using the Commission's criteria and adapted regional cutoffs, and to generate ethnicity-specific reference curves for waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR).<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional analysis used nationally representative data from 2021 to 2023 Peruvian Demographic and Health Surveys (ENDES), including 84,622 adults aged ≥20 years. Clinical obesity was defined as excess body fat (BMI, WC, or WHtR) plus diabetes or hypertension diagnosis. Preclinical obesity was defined as excess body fat without clinical dysfunction. Age-adjusted prevalence estimates were calculated using four anthropometric criteria and stratified by sex. Ethnicity-specific WC and WHtR reference curves were generated using GAMLSS models, stratified by age and sex.<h4>Findings</h4>A total of 84,622 participants were included in the study. Among these participants, mean age was 44.1 (range: 20-97) years, and 48,300 participants (51.7%) were female. Clinical obesity age-adjusted prevalence ranged from 15.7% to 22.1%, and preclinical obesity from 28.7% to 53.8%, depending on cutoffs used. Up to 13.5% of individuals with normal BMI and 21% of those overweight met criteria for clinical obesity. Women showed the highest prevalence estimates of preclinical obesity, ranging from 33.4% to 65.8%, whereas men reached their highest prevalence (41.3%) when the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) cutoffs were applied. In the case of clinical obesity, women had higher prevalence estimates of clinical obesity when applying the Lancet Commission approach (18.7%) and the Peruvian national guidelines (21.4%). Men showed higher prevalence estimates when using the cutoffs proposed by the Latin American Consortium of Studies in Obesity (LASO) (16.8%) and the IDF (22.8%). Reference curves showed that Quechua-Aymara individuals had lower WC and WHtR values compared to Afro-Peruvian and other groups at the 97th percentile, in both men and women.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Reliance on BMI alone underestimates a large proportion of clinically relevant cases. Incorporating WC-measurements and clinical dysfunction into diagnostic frameworks could improve identification, prevention, and policy responses to obesity in Peru and similar settings.<h4>Funding</h4>The authors received no financial support.",2025,[],[]
Circulating mediators linking cardiometabolic diseases to HFpEF: a mediation Mendelian randomization analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. Although HFpEF frequently coexists with cardiometabolic diseases, the causal mechanisms and potential mediators remain poorly understood.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to identify cardiometabolic risk factors specifically driving HFpEF and to determine their underlying circulating mediators.<h4>Methods</h4>We used two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) to analyze the effects of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and dyslipidemia on HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in large European-ancestry GWAS datasets. We then performed mediation MR to identify plasma proteins and metabolites that mediate the transition from each cardiometabolic disease to HFpEF, respectively. We applied multivariable MR to assess the impact of risk confounding on the results. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to delineate mechanisms.<h4>Results</h4>Cardiometabolic diseases had heterogeneous effects on HFpEF and HFrEF. Obesity and type 2 diabetes showed adjusted causal effects with HFpEF, hypertension showed potential relevance to HFpEF, whereas dyslipidemia and CKD did not. MR analysis identified 5 proteins that mediate obesity to HFpEF; 5 proteins that mediate type 2 diabetes to HFpEF. Further mediation MR analysis of obesity and T2D on HFrEF revealed heterogeneity in circulating mediators between metabolic HFpEF and HFrEF. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses showed that IL1R1, together with other proteins such as TP53 and FGF19, orchestrates the inflammatory and fibrotic processes underlying HFpEF.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest that metabolic HFpEF has distinct etiological features compared with HFrEF and is driven by complex, condition-specific mediators. IL1R1 mediates HFpEF in multiple metabolic risk states, suggesting a potential therapeutic target. Further translational studies are warranted to evaluate anti-inflammatory strategies targeting IL1R1 in HFpEF.",2025,"['hf', '##f', 'hfpef', 'il1r1', 'tp53', 'fgf19', 'il1r1', 'hfpef', 'il1r1']","['il1r1', 'tp53', 'fgf19']"
Investigating the association between parental educational status and offspring obesity risk using the Japan Environment and Children's Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Previous studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and childhood obesity in affluent nations, with parental education as a key factor. However, the meaning of socioeconomic indicators may vary by race and country, and research on this topic in Asian countries is limited.<h4>Objectives</h4>We investigated the association between parents' educational status and childhood obesity in Japan.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized data from Japan's birth cohort, recruiting participants from 2011 to 2014, and included 49 564 children. Parental educational status was categorized into four groups: both parents with lower education (LM-LF), mothers with higher education and fathers with lower education (HM-LF), mothers with lower education and fathers with higher education (LM-HF), and both parents with higher education (HM-HF). Multivariable logistic regression analyzed the association between parental education and overweight/obesity among 4-year-old children.<h4>Results</h4>Of the participants, 17.9%, 16.9%, 16.2% and 15.4% were overweight/obese; and 5.5%, 4.6%, 4.4% and 3.8% were obese in LM-LF, HM-LF, LM-HF and HM-HF groups, respectively. When the reference group was defined as children born to parents with HM-HF, the adjusted odds ratios for overweight/obesity in LM-LF, HM-LF and LM-HF were 1.13 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.06-1.21), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01-1.15) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.95-1.12); and those for obesity were 1.34 (95% CI: 1.20-1.50), 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04-1.31) and 1.11 (95% CI: 0.96-1.28), respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Lower educational status in both parents was associated with overweight/obesity among 4-year-old children in Japan. Public policies might target parents with lower education to prevent childhood obesity.",2025,[],[]
Opposing profiles of Netrin-1 and adiponectin in metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity-driven low-grade inflammation contributes to insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic dysfunction. Beyond its axon-guidance role, Netrin-1 promotes macrophage retention in inflamed adipose tissue, whereas adiponectin exerts anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing effects. We aimed to compare serum Netrin-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and adiponectin across metabolic profiles and assess their associations with systemic inflammation.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in adults (n = 60): metabolically healthy controls (C, n = 20), preclinical obesity (PO; HOMA-IR < 2.5, n = 20), and clinical obesity with insulin resistance (CO; HOMA-IR>2.5, n = 20). Anthropometrics, fasting glucose/insulin, lipid profile, and serum biomarkers were obtained; group differences and correlations were analyzed (non-parametric tests where appropriate).<h4>Results</h4>Between-group testing showed higher Netrin-1 in CO versus controls (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.013; C < CO), with no significant difference versus PO. IL-6 was elevated in both PO and CO versus controls (Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.001). hs-CRP peaked in PO versus both C and CO (Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.001). Adiponectin was lower in CO and inversely correlated with hs-CRP (r = -0.22) and IL-6 (r = -0.53, p < 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>Circulating Netrin-1 and adiponectin display opposing profiles aligned with pro- versus anti-inflammatory signaling in metabolic dysfunction. These findings support the Netrin-1/adiponectin axis as an immunometabolic marker set in early IR states. The cross-sectional design limits causal inference; longitudinal studies integrating tissue-level measurements are warranted.",2025,"['insulin', 'netrin - 1', 'adiponectin', 'insulin', 'netrin - 1', 'interleukin - 6', 'il - 6', 'high - sensitivity c - reactive protein', 'hs - crp', 'adiponectin', 'homa - i', 'insulin', 'homa - ir', 'insulin', 'netrin - 1', 'il - 6', 'hs - crp', 'adiponectin', 'hs - crp', 'il - 6', 'netrin - 1', 'adiponectin', 'netrin - 1', 'adiponectin']","['insulin', 'netrin 1', 'adiponectin', 'interleukin 6', 'high sensitivity c reactive protein']"
"Psoriasis, stem cells, and obesity: metabolic exploration for therapeutics.","Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease with a complex pathogenesis that remains incompletely understood. New data suggest that psoriasis severity may be more accurately assessed by examining inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormones, although further research is needed to substantiate the clinical value of these biomarkers. The multifactorial causes of psoriasis encompass metabolic deregulations, such as lipid alterations that favor inflammation, exacerbate immune cell activity, and worsen the disease symptomatology. The pathophysiological link between psoriasis and obesity may be revealed through a crosstalk between adipocytes and the immune system, mediated by diverse soluble mediators, including adipokines. In this autoimmune disease, dermal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are potential cellular players that connect autoimmune mechanisms, inflammation, and dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Networks of soluble factors, immune and non-immune cells, and MSCs mediate the inflammatory state in psoriasis. In many recent studies, the relapse has been associated with the potential role of MSCs in this process, endorsing MSCs as a new therapeutic reservoir in psoriasis. Thus, in our review, we aimed to evaluate the potential connection between autoimmunity, inflammation, and dermal mesenchymal stem cells, along with dysregulation of lipid metabolism, to elucidate the identity of psoriasis and identify potential new diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets.",2025,[],[]
TLR5's Role in Obesity-related Hypertension: Updated Evidence and Prospects.,"Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), integral to the immune system as a primary sensor for flagellin, is central to the link between innate and adaptive immunity, modulating immune responses and cytokine production essential for defense against flagellated pathogens and immune tolerance. This review consolidates the understanding of TLR5's structural and signaling mechanisms and its interactions with flagellin, shedding light on its dual role in immune responses and its promise as a therapeutic target. It highlights TLR5's intricate role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related hypertension, a growing global health concern that correlates with rising obesity rates and is characterized by a complex interplay of immune responses and metabolic dysregulation. Despite the current understanding, the impact of TLR5 on obesity-related hypertension is marked by conflicting findings, indicating a need for further exploration. The review critically analyzes the existing literature, providing novel insights from rodent models and human studies that underscore TLR5's therapeutic potential, setting the stage for transformative research in managing obesity-related hypertension. It calls for deeper investigation into TLR5's multifaceted role, emphasizing its promise as a target for managing obesity-related hypertension and the necessity for future research to clarify its complexities and to innovate treatment strategies.",2025,"['toll - like receptor 5', 'tlr5', 'flagellin', 'tlr5', 'flagellin', 'tlr5', 'tlr5', 'tlr5', 'tlr5']","['toll like receptor 5', 'tlr5', 'flagellin']"
Reversing metabolic dysregulation in farnesoid X receptor knockout mice via gut microbiota modulation.,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), expressed in the liver and in the small intestine, is a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. Its pharmacological modulation is explored as a potential treatment for obesity-related metabolic impairments. To develop effective pharmacological interventions, it is crucial to differentiate the individual contributions of intestinal and hepatic FXR to lipid metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of intestinal FXR ablation on gut microbiome composition and metabolic potential in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Additionally, we determined the genotype-specific effects of xanthohumol, a hop-derived ligand of FXR, known to mitigate metabolic dysfunction in HFD-fed mice. Intestinal FXR knockout prevented diet-induced obesity, a phenotype that correlated with a decrease in the predicted functional capacity of the gut microbiome. Intestinal FXR deficiency resulted in increased abundances of bacteria producing secondary bile acids, such as Oscillospira, and a decrease in beneficial bacteria, such as Akkermansia, both of which were mitigated by xanthohumol. Our findings provide insights to understand the contribution of intestinal FXR and gut microbiome to metabolic regulation under HFD conditions. We underscore the ability of xanthohumol to restore homeostasis, highlighting its potential to improve gut health.",2025,"['farnesoid x receptor', 'fxr', 'hepatic fxr', '##test', '##inal fxr', 'fxr', '##testinal fxr', 'fxr', 'in', '##testinal fxr']","['farnesoid x receptor', 'fxr']"
Mild Mitochondrial Uncoupling for True Ectopic Lipid Disposal.,"Ectopic lipid accumulation is a core contributor to insulin resistance and metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conventional therapies have primarily focused on redistributing lipid burden across tissues or modulating specific pathways. However, this often causes compensatory responses that merely shift the burden rather than resolve the underlying lipid excess. In this review, we introduce the concept of the ballooning effect, wherein single-target interventions inadvertently exacerbate lipid accumulation in non-target tissues. We then explore fundamental strategies for true lipid disposal, which aim either to prevent lipid influx or to promote complete lipid oxidation. Among these, mild mitochondrial uncoupling emerges as a promising solution. By dissipating substrate energy as heat, mitochondrial uncoupling reduces ectopic lipid burden without relying on redistribution. Recent advances have yielded safer chemical uncouplers and novel endogenous protein-based mechanisms that enable controlled uncoupling with minimal toxicity. Together, these provide a new framework for next-generation metabolic therapies that move beyond lipid redistribution and aim for a true lipid disposal, potentially offering a safe and effective strategy.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Targeted Overexpression of Mitochondrial ALDH2 in Coronary Endothelial Cells Mitigates HFpEF in a Diabetic Mouse Model.,"Heart failure (HF) has become an epidemic, with a prevalence of ~7 million cases in the USA. Despite accounting for nearly 50% of all HF cases, heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains challenging to treat. Common pathophysiological mechanisms in HFpEF include oxidative stress, microvascular dysfunction, and chronic unresolved inflammation. Our lab focuses on oxidative stress-mediated cellular dysfunction, particularly the toxic effects of lipid peroxidation products like 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a mitochondrial enzyme, plays a vital role in detoxifying 4HNE and thereby protecting the heart against pathological stress. ALDH2 activity is reduced in various metabolic stress-mediated cardiac pathologies. The dysfunction of coronary vascular endothelial cells (CVECs) is critical in initiating HFpEF development. Thus, we hypothesized that ectopic overexpression of ALDH2 in CVECs could mitigate metabolic stress-induced HFpEF pathogenesis. In this study, we tested the efficacy of intracardiac injections of the <i>ALDH2</i> gene into CVECs in <i>db</i>/<i>db</i> mice-a model of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-and their controls, <i>db</i>/<i>m</i> mice, by injection with ALDH2 constructs (AAV9-VE-cadherin-hALDH2-HA tag-P2A) or control constructs (AAV9-VE-cadherin-HA tag-P2A-eGFP). We found that intracardiac ALDH2 gene transfer increased ALDH2 levels specifically in CVECs compared to other myocardial cells. Additionally, we observed increased ALDH2 levels and activity, along with decreased 4HNE adducts, in the hearts of mice receiving <i>ALDH2</i> gene transfer compared to control GFP transfer. Furthermore, <i>ALDH2</i> gene transfer to CVECs improved diastolic function compared to GFP control alone. In conclusion, ectopic ALDH2 expression in CVECs can contribute, at least partially, to the amelioration of HFpEF.",2025,"['aldehyde dehydrogenase 2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', '##av9 - ve - cadherin', 'haldh2', 'ha', '##2', '##av9 - ve - cadherin', 'ha', '##2', 'egf', 'aldh2 gene', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2', 'aldh2']","['aldh2', 'egf']"
Exosome Trafficking Is a Key Regulator of Adipocyte Thermogenesis,"Activation of beige adipocytes enhances energy expenditure and promotes metabolic health, presenting a promising approach for combating obesity and diabetes. As part of this process, thermogenesis, fueled in part by uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, plays a central role in converting calories into thermal energy, thereby preventing their storage as fat. Here, we identify a role for exosome trafficking as an intrinsic regulator of beige adipocyte thermogenesis. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate cell-cell and intracellular communication by transporting regulatory cargo, including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids. Using both human cells and mouse models, we show that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes promotes the rapid release of exosomes enriched in microRNAs known to suppress thermogenic programs. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of exosome secretion attenuates thermogenesis, whereas enhancing exosome release amplifies thermogenic output. Mice deficient in the exosome secretion regulator Rab27a exhibit reduced energy expenditure in response to both cold exposure and β3-adrenergic stimulation. These findings establish exosome trafficking as a key contributor to beige adipocyte thermogenic capacity, highlighting an intracellular mechanism that may be leveraged to enhance energy expenditure and treat obesity-related metabolic diseases. <h4>Significance Statement</h4>  Thermogenic adipocytes, including beige fat cells, help maintain energy balance by converting excess nutrients into heat, thereby reducing fat storage and supporting metabolic function. Although these cells are known to promote energy expenditure, the intracellular processes that enable their full thermogenic response are not well defined. Here, we show that exosome secretion is required for beige adipocytes to reach their full thermogenic potential. Blocking exosome release dampens this response, while boosting it amplifies thermogenic output. These findings point to exosome release as an essential part of thermogenic regulation and a potential target for improving metabolic health.",2025,['rab27a'],['rab27a']
miR-146b/Btg2 axis as a potential inducer of islet beta-cell decline during the progression of obesity to T2DM.,"We evaluated the potential mechanisms responsible for inducing beta-cell decline during the progression of obesity to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Between February 2021 and February 2022, 25 subjects with non-diabetic obesity, 20 subjects with obesity and new-onset T2DM, and 25 healthy volunteers were recruited. Circulating exosome-contained miRNA expression profiling was performed by miRNA sequencing. The role of specific miRNA was analyzed by a gain-of-function approach in Min6 beta-cells, mouse islets, and human islets. Expression of 83 exosomal miRNAs was differently regulated in the circulation of subjects with non-diabetic obesity. We focused on miR-146b, which was mildly up-regulated in non-diabetic obesity and dramatically up-regulated in obese new-onset T2DM. Using an obese diabetic <i>db/db</i> mouse model, we found the expression of miR-146b to be mainly increased in islets. Overexpression of miR-146b in mouse beta-cells, mouse islets, and human islets <i>in vitro</i> facilitated beta-cell apoptosis yet inhibited its proliferation and insulin synthesis, leading to impaired insulin secretion. Eventually, miR-146b directly targeted the B cell translocation gene 2 (<i>Btg2</i>), an antiapoptotic transcriptional factor. Overexpression of <i>Btg2</i> reversed miR-146b-induced apoptosis and -suppressed proliferation in beta-cells. miR-146b that targets <i>Btg2</i> might be a predictive biomarker and an inducer of beta-cell decline.",2025,"['mir - 146b', 'mir - 146b', 'mir - 146b', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'mir - 146b', 'b cell translocation gene 2', 'mir - 146b', 'mir - 146b']",['insulin']
Association between pediatric obesity and foot morphology: insights from a large-scale cross-sectional study using photogrammetry.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity is a critical public health concern with implications for musculoskeletal development. Foot posture abnormalities-particularly pes planus-may be associated with obesity and could serve as early diagnostic indicators.<h4>Aim</h4>This study investigated the relationship between foot posture and obesity in children aged 4-14 years using non-invasive assessment methods.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A total of 7,908 children (mean age: 8.7 ± 2.9 years; 51.2% male) were assessed using photogrammetry and the Staheli Arch Index, along with the Jack Test to classify foot posture. BMI categories and foot posture types were statistically compared.<h4>Results</h4>Rigid pes planus was found in 9.6% of children, flexible pes planus in 7.8%, and high arch in 3.8%. Among overweight and obese children, the prevalence of rigid pes planus was significantly higher (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that rigid pes planus increased the risk of obesity by 7.2 times (OR = 7.156; 95% CI: 5.179-9.887).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Rigid pes planus is strongly associated with obesity in children. Foot posture screening, especially in early childhood, may serve as a valuable tool for identifying children at risk for obesity-related complications and guiding early preventive interventions.",2025,[],[]
"GLP-1-based therapies for diabetes, obesity and beyond.","Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality.

Association of cardiorespiratory fitness with phenotypic age in younger population: a study based on the NHANES database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Phenotypic age (PA), a novel signature of morbidity and mortality risk based on clinically collected parameters, is considered one of the most promising biomarkers for capturing aging. However, unequivocal evidence on the link between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), assessed by estimated maximal oxygen consumption (Vo<sub>2max</sub>), and PA remains scarce, particularly within the first half of life. This study aims to explore the relationships between CRF and the age-adjusted value derived from the residuals of the regression of PA on chronological age (PhenoageAcceleration: PAA), uncovering the prognostic value of CRF in the early lifetime to provide perspectives for understanding and improving healthy aging.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from 3,069 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included and further examined. CRF status was determined by Vo<sub>2max</sub> according to gender and age-specific criteria, with low and moderate levels classified as impaired CRF. PA was calculated from multisystem blood biomarkers and chronological age. The association of CRF status with cross-sectional PAA was investigated, and subgroup analyses were further performed to explore and identify potentially vulnerable populations.<h4>Results</h4>In the multivariable logistical regression analysis, maintenance of CRF was significantly and inversely associated with PAA, demonstrating a decreased risk of 42% in the high CRF group [OR (95% CI): 0.58 (0.36, 0.96), <i>p</i> = 0.033]. Compared with those with non-impaired CRF, those in the impaired group exhibited a rise in PA by 1.46 years [<i>β</i> (95% CI): 1.46 (1.03, 2.10), <i>p</i> = 0.040]. Interestingly, in the population of over 29 years' old, a significant interaction between obesity and impaired CRF for PAA was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.018; <i>p</i> = 0.026).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Poor CRF may serve as a potential risk factor for accelerated biological aging (BA) in relatively young populations, and the existence of obesity could exacerbate the aging process. This represents a potential intervention target for promoting healthy aging across different age groups in the future.",2025,[],[]
Visceral adipocyte metabolic dysfunction in obesity related to altered chromatin accessibility to thyroid hormone receptor.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To explore the alterations in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) during obesity and identify the underlying mechanism causing the onset of VAT dysfunction.<h4>Methods</h4>Histological staining on human VAT was utilized. VAT samples were collected from individuals with normal weight (n = 3, BMI 21.77 ± 0.709) and obesity (n = 3, BMI 32.95 ± 1.815). RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were employed. In vitro cell experiment, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay and RNA interference were conducted.<h4>Results</h4>Our research identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of VAT from individuals with normal wight or obesity enriched in pathways related to adipocyte metabolic function, thyroid hormone receptor binding sites were discovered in the accessible chromatin regions of these DEGs, including STAT5B. Motif enrichment, CHIP assay and in vitro cell experiments confirmed the decreased activation of STAT5B by triiodothyronine (T3) through binding with thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRa) in obesity. In addition, RNA interference revealed STAT5B as a key transcription factor in maintaining the metabolic function of VAT.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In obesity, VAT metabolic function impairment is related to altered chromatin accessibility to thyroid hormone receptor. STAT5B is a key transcription factor at the core of the disrupted thyroid-adipose signaling and might be a promising target to improve obesity.",2025,"['thyroid hormone receptor binding sites', 'stat5b', 'stat5b', 'thyroid hormone receptor alpha', 'thra', 'stat5b', 'thyroid hormone receptor', 'stat5b']","['stat5b', 'thyroid hormone receptor alpha', 'thra', 'thyroid hormone receptor']"
Obesity as the predominant contributor to asthma burden: insights from GBD and NHANES analyses.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study describes the global asthma burden trends from 1990 to 2021 and identifies key risk factors contributing to changes in asthma burden, focusing on the impact of obesity on asthma burden.<h4>Methods</h4>We extracted asthma incidence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database (1990-2021), stratifying by age, sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Temporal trends were evaluated using Joinpoint regression. Decomposition analysis quantified contributions of population growth, aging, and age-specific rates to DALY changes. Frontier analysis evaluated SDI regions' effectiveness in reducing asthma burden. To evaluate the impact of obesity, we further analyzed risk-attributable DALYs and, using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2021-2023), performed multivariable logistic regression examining associations between body-mass index (BMI) and asthma outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>Although age-standardized incidence and mortality rates declined, asthma remained prevalent in 2021 with an estimated 37 million new cases and 21.4 million DALYs, disproportionately affecting children (0-14 years) and older adults (55-74 years). Decomposition analysis attributed most DALY increases to demographic changes, particularly population growth and aging. Frontier analysis showed that while high-SDI regions achieved notable reductions in burden, rising obesity rates expanded the at-risk population even in these areas. High BMI emerged as the leading global risk factor for asthma-related DALYs-ranking first in high-SDI regions and, since the late 2010s, in low-SDI regions as well. NHANES analyses confirmed that individuals with asthma exhibited significantly higher BMI (Non- Asthma: 29.4 ± 7.32, Asthma: 31.2 ± 8.48, P < 0.001) Adjusted regression demonstrated that obesity independently predicted asthma onset and progression across all age groups (BMI Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.68.) CONCLUSION: Despite declines in standardized rates, asthma continues to impose a heavy global burden, concentrated in vulnerable age groups, especially among the young and elderly. Obesity has emerged as the foremost modifiable risk factor worldwide. Tailored public health strategies focusing on weight management are urgently needed to curb asthma incidence and severity.",2025,[],[]
"Lipid Profile, Obesity Indicators and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in School-Aged Children and Adolescents: Sex-Specific Associations.","<b>Background</b>: Childhood obesity and cardiometabolic disturbances are growing global health concerns.

Mechanisms Linking Obesity with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)-The Role of Oxidative Stress.,"Obesity concerns a wide range of the population, tending to become a major factor for diseases' progression and fatality rate increases, with implications concerning the cardiovascular system's deterioration. Obesity is closely linked with metabolic derangements concerning lipid storage and circulation, and the cellular metabolism affecting most of the internal organs, especially liver and cellular function. In this current study, an analysis of the linking mechanisms between obesity, lipid deterioration, liver, and lipid tissue homeostasis will be performed, with special attention to the pathophysiological characteristics of these detrimental effects on the NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and the cellular function of the endothelial blood cells, with special reference to the additional burdening of obesity on the autonomous nervous system signaling, and the resulting hypertension. Despite the very complex and pluripotent pathogenic mechanisms with which obesity is intervening in these processes, it could be safely deduced that metabolic and lipid transport manipulation could serve as a crucial factor towards the cellular and tissue function improvement, as the interlinkages in the mechanisms, although highly analyzed, have not been completely deciphered until now.",2025,[],[]

TSPO deficiency reveals a novel role for porphyrins in regulating white adipose tissue lipid metabolism,"The translocator protein (TSPO) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein with high expression in cells specialized for lipid metabolism, including white adipose tissue (WAT), where its physiological function remains poorly defined. Our previous work demonstrated a role for TSPO in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, prompting us to investigate its contribution to adipocyte lipid homeostasis under metabolic stress. We employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches using global Tspo knockout ( Tspo -/- ) mice, primary adipocyte cultures, and pharmacological TSPO-binding drugs to examine TSPO function. We show that Tspo -/- mice exhibited increased WAT mass and adipocyte hypertrophy following high-fat diet feeding, with no changes in caloric intake. These changes were accompanied by suppression of key lipolytic genes, reduced circulating NEFA and glycerol levels, and altered expression of fatty acid oxidation genes. Lipidomic profiling showed no genotype-dependent changes, indicating impaired mobilization rather than altered lipid composition. In vitro , TSPO deficiency enhanced lipid accumulation during adipocyte diberentiation and impaired expression of lipolytic genes. TSPO-binding drugs phenocopied this response in TSPO-expressing cells. Mechanistically, we identify protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), an endogenous TSPO ligand, as a suppressor of adipogenic and lipolytic programs. PPIX levels increase during adipogenesis, and its accrual inhibits both lipid accumulation and lipolytic response, whereas hemin does not elicit these ebects. Our findings identify TSPO as a regulator of adipocyte lipid metabolism through a previously unrecognized TSPO-PPIX axis that influences lipid mobilization in adipocytes. This mechanism provides insight into TSPO’s role in metabolic adaptation and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in obesity-associated adipose dysfunction.",2025,"['translocator protein', 'tspo', 'mitochondrial outer membrane protein', 'tspo', 'tspo', 'tspo', 'tspo', 'tspo', 'tsp', 'nefa', 'tspo', 'tsp', 'tspo', 'protoporphyrin ix', 'ppix', 'tspo', 'ppix', 'hemin', 'tspo', 'tspo', 'ppix', 'tspo']","['translocator protein', 'tspo', 'mitochondrial outer membrane protein', 'tsp', 'nefa', 'protoporphyrin ix', 'ppix', 'hemin']"
The Oncogenic Burden of Obesity: Mechanistic Links Between Adiposity and Gastrointestinal Cancers-A Comprehensive Narrative Review.,"Obesity is a global health crisis with profound implications for cancer risk, particularly within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Mounting evidence demonstrates that excess adiposity contributes to the initiation, progression, and poor outcomes of GI malignancies through a constellation of interrelated mechanisms. This review comprehensively examines the biologic pathways linking obesity to cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Chronic low-grade inflammation, driven by adipose tissue-derived cytokines and immune cell infiltration, plays a central role in tumorigenesis via the activation of NF-κB, STAT3, and other pro-oncogenic signaling cascades. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance increase mitogenic IGF-1 signaling, while dysregulated adipokines, particularly elevated leptin and reduced adiponectin, promote cellular proliferation and impair tumor suppression. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and alterations in bile acid metabolism generate carcinogenic metabolites that contribute to DNA damage and immune evasion. Additionally, obesity-induced tissue hypoxia fosters tumor growth through HIF-1α-mediated pathways. We further highlight organ-specific associations, such as visceral adiposity's role in Barrett's esophagus and hepatocellular carcinoma emerging from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Importantly, emerging data suggest that weight loss, achieved via lifestyle, pharmacologic, or surgical interventions, may mitigate these carcinogenic pathways and improve tumor biology. As obesity prevalence continues to rise globally, elucidating its mechanistic ties to GI malignancies is essential for risk stratification, prevention strategies, and personalized care. By integrating epidemiologic and molecular insights, this review underscores the need for multidisciplinary approaches to curb the oncogenic burden of obesity and improve outcomes in GI oncology.",2025,"['nf - κb', 'stat3', 'insulin', 'igf - 1', 'leptin', 'adiponectin', 'hif - 1α']","['stat3', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'adiponectin']"
Metformin reduces the risk of frailty: evidence from a Mendelian randomization study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metformin is a widely used antidiabetic agent for obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus, providing significant health benefits such as reduced blood glucose levels and body weight. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin may play a beneficial role in delaying aging. However, the causal relationship between metformin use and frailty index (FI) remains uncertain and warrants further investigation. This study aimed to explore the genetically predicted causal relationship between metformin targets and FI.<h4>Methods</h4>A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted. Genetic proxies for the target effects of metformin were identified as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with body weight and corresponding gene expression levels. Summary statistics for the FI were obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Additionally, a two-step MR approach was employed to explore whether glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) exhibits a mediating effect on the relationship between body weight and frailty risk. In the MR analysis, the inverse variance weighted method served as the primary analytical approach, supplemented by sensitivity analyses.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 10 SNPs were included as genetic predictors of metformin. The average effect of the genetic proxies for metformin targets, equivalent to a 1 standard deviation reduction in body weight, was associated with a reduced FI (β: -0.41, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.07, P = 0.017). Notably, weight reduction induced by the target Mitochondrial complex I (MCI) showed a role in reducing FI. Furthermore, HbA1c mediated 5.5% of the total effect of body weight on FI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The findings of this study support the notion that metformin may reduce frailty risk through the target MCI, with this effect potentially being partially attributable to weight reduction. These findings provide new insights for developing therapeutic strategies targeting aging and frailty prevention.",2025,"['glycated haemoglobin', 'hba1c', 'hba1c']",['hba1c']

UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis was conducted to identify and quantify the major phenolic compounds in TCE. Mice were administered low and high doses of TCE, and various metabolic parameters, including lipid profiles, liver function markers, adipokine levels, and gene/protein expressions related to lipid metabolism and inflammation, were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis identified four major phenolic compounds in TCE-gallic acid, orientin, vitexin, and ellagic acid-with respective contents of 112.5, 163.3, 184.7, and 295.7 mg/g extract. TCE administration significantly reduced liver and adipose tissue weights, along with hepatic and adipose lipid accumulation. Both low and high doses of TCE markedly lowered serum lipid levels. Liver function was improved, as indicated by reduced levels of AST, ALT, and ALP, while BUN levels remained unchanged. On the molecular level, TCE downregulated adipogenic and lipogenic genes (PPARγ, PPARα, C/EBPα, aP2) and upregulated metabolic regulators, including leptin, adiponectin, p-HSL/HSL, and p-perilipin/perilipin, without affecting ATGL expression.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea: An Evolving Therapeutic Landscape with an Emerging Role for Incretin-Based Therapies.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. OSA is a highly prevalent condition, strongly associated with obesity and linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. While traditional therapies such as positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are effective in treating OSA and alleviating daytime symptoms, they are often not well tolerated and have limited impact on long-term cardiovascular outcomes. As our understanding of the heterogenous factors driving OSA advances, novel therapies targeting specific physiological traits-such as arousal threshold, ventilatory instability, and upper airway muscle responsiveness-are being actively explored, with a promise to expand our therapeutic arsenal. Notably, the recent approval of tirzepatide for the treatment of obesity-related OSA marks a significant milestone in this evolving therapeutic landscape. This incretin-based drug, previously approved for diabetes and obesity management, offers dual benefits, promoting weight loss and improving OSA severity and symptoms.

There were no statistically significant differences in thyromental height test, thyromental distance, neck circumference, and mouth opening scores. Male sex, TMD ≤ 175 mm, and MO ≤ 60.5 mm were predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. The OPERA Score (range 0-5) demonstrated superior predictive value (AUC = 0.8 <i>p</i> < 0.01), outperforming its individual components. <b>Conclusions</b>: Male sex, TMD ≤ 175 mm, and MO ≤ 60.5 mm are predictors for difficult laryngoscopy in patients with obesity. The results of our study indicate that TMH may not be a good predictor of difficult intubation in patients with obesity. However, when integrated into a composite score, it contributes meaningfully to a multifactorial risk assessment.",2025,[],[]
Foodservice Models and Nutrition Practices in Spinal Facilities: Insights and Opportunities for Improvement From a Pilot Multinational Survey.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) often experience prolonged hospitalisations and are almost entirely reliant on the foodservices provided by these facilities for their nutrition and hydration needs. However, the impact of foodservice systems and dining models on patients with SCI remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate foodservice systems and practices employed across spinal inpatient facilities.<h4>Methods</h4>A descriptive, cross-sectional online survey was completed anonymously by purposively recruited dietitians employed in spinal inpatient facilities worldwide. The primary measures included aspects of foodservice systems, dining models and related nutrition practices, such as the nutritional targets of the menu, and other clinical foodservice-related information. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, including percentages and frequencies, while qualitative free-text responses were evaluated using conventional content analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Sixteen dietitians from five countries participated in the survey, with the majority representing rehabilitation facilities (10/16; 63%). These facilities reported in-house, cook-fresh food production systems and café-style dining models (6/10; 60%). A daily energy target for the menu, ranging from 1500 to 2700 kcal/day, was reported by 12/16 facilities (75%). A daily protein target of 80-110 g/day was reported by 10/16 facilities (63%), while only three facilities (19%) reported having a daily variable saturated fat target.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This novel study provides valuable insights into foodservices within spinal inpatient facilities, highlighting variability in the nutrient goals of menus across different sites. Particularly, the limited focus on saturated fat, despite the elevated cardiovascular risk in this population needs consideration. Future research should explore these issues in a larger, diverse sample and work toward standardising tangible nutrition practices to improve the quality of care and nutritional outcomes.",2025,[],[]
The Goldilocks for chronic weight management-Balancing quantity with quality of weight loss.,"Anti-obesity medications have reached new heights in terms of efficacy, with presently available pharmacological options almost reaching the efficacy of the surgical techniques, and thus these are starting to fill the treatment void. Because of the increased weight loss efficacy, benefits on a host of obesity complications are being reported, with prevention of diabetes, reduction of liver and cardiovascular complications and improvements in osteoarthritis among the prominent features. On the other hand, present anti-obesity strategies also lead to loss of lean and bone mass, and while the consequences hereof are only beginning to present, they are highly likely to be of importance in a target population that contains a large number of elderly and potentially frail individuals. Therefore, there is a need to address the issue of weight loss quality, both in the context of existing possibilities, but especially in the context of the myriad of novel anti-obesity medications on the horizon.",2025,[],[]
"Anti-Obesity, Lipid-Lowering, and Anti-Hyperglycemic Effects of CB-02 in High-Fat-Diet-Induced Obese Mice.","Obesity, along with dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, is a metabolic disorder growing in prevalence that is linked to chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. This study evaluated the anti-obesity, lipid-lowering, and anti-hyperglycemic effects of CB-02 capsules containing dry extracts of <i>Phyllanthus emblica</i> L., <i>Dendrobium catenatum</i> Lindl., and <i>Gynostemma pentaphyllum</i> in HFD-induced obese Swiss albino mice. After 12 weeks of HFD induction, mice were treated orally with CB-02 (576 or 1152 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. CB-02 significantly reduced BW gain, AC, the Lee obesity index, and the relative weights of visceral fat and major organs. It also improved lipid profiles by decreasing TC, TG, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C, while increasing HDL-C. These effects were comparable to orlistat (60 mg/kg/day). Furthermore, CB-02 lowered fasting glucose and improved insulin sensitivity, as indicated by an increased QUICKI and HOMA-β and reduced HOMA-IR. Histopathological evaluation showed that CB-02 reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration and also attenuated β-cell morphological alterations and pancreatic histopathological damage. These results suggest that CB-02 may be a promising therapeutic candidate for managing obesity and its comorbidities, including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis, contributing to the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in obese individuals.",2025,"['tg', 'ldl - c', 'non - hdl - c', 'hdl - c', 'insulin', 'homa - β', 'homa - ir']",['insulin']
Perirenal Fat in Disease Progression: From Inflammatory Mediator to Therapeutic Target.,"Perirenal fat (PRF), the adipose tissue that encases the kidneys, has long been considered a passive energy reservoir and mechanical buffer. However, emerging evidence has identified PRF as a biologically active visceral fat depot that secretes adipocytokines, inflammatory mediators, and other bioactive molecules, and thereby contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of several systemic diseases. PRF is associated with renal cell carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. In renal cell carcinoma, PRF thickness correlates positively with tumor stage and negatively with prognosis. In cardiovascular and renal disorders, PRF accumulation is linked to elevated blood pressure and impaired renal function. Furthermore, PRF promotes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that exacerbates chronic kidney disease and metabolic abnormalities. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of PRF, both as a diagnostic and prognostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the roles of PRF in disease development and progression and emphasizes its emerging significance in clinical practice.",2025,"['prf', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'prf', 'prf', 'prf']",[]
Inflammation: a key mechanism connecting metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease and systemic arterial hypertension.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver condition worldwide. The increase in the prevalence of MASLD is linked to the global rise in obesity. MASLD encompasses a disease spectrum beginning with simple steatosis that may progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma. Clinical studies highlight the bidirectional relationship between MASLD and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), showing that MASLD patients have a higher risk of developing SAH. Likewise, hypertensive patients show an increased susceptibility to MASLD, suggesting mutual pathogenic mechanisms. Inflammation is a shared pathway between these two entities; MASLD pathogenesis encompasses hepatic lipotoxicity, inducing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, which promote systemic inflammation, contributing to vascular remodeling, increased blood pressure, and deregulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), potentially contributing to SAH. On the other hand, chronic hypertension promotes hepatic inflammation through immune and neuroendocrine pathways, favoring progression from MASLD to MASH. This review, emphasizing the pro-inflammatory factors, explores the inflammatory crosstalk between MASLD and SAH. Understanding this interplay provides a comprehensive perspective on chronic inflammation that could link liver and vascular pathologies, offering potential therapeutic targets for treating both conditions.",2025,"['renin', 'angiotensin', 'r']","['renin', 'angiotensin']"
Fucoxanthin-Loaded Solid Lipid Nanoparticles Exert Potent Therapeutic Efficacy in Combating High-Fat Diet Induced Obesity in Mice.,"Obesity and associated metabolic disorders pose significant health challenges. Fucoxanthin, a lipophilic compound, has shown promising anti-obesity potential, but its poor solubility and bioavailability limit therapeutic efficacy. The successful formulation of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) amplified fucoxanthin's efficacy in mitigating obesity and the associated metabolic dysregulation. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice were treated with free fucoxanthin, lyophilized SLNs (L-SLN), and dispersed SLNs (D-SLN) loaded with fucoxanthin. The intervention with D-SLN demonstrated the most significant reduction in body weight gain (29.94%) and fat mass gain (61.80%) compared to the HFD group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), alongside notable improvements in metabolic indicators including fasting blood glucose, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and inflammatory markers such as leptin and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) levels. Histopathological evaluation corroborated these findings, showing highly reduced hepatic lipid droplet accumulation and improved adipocyte and testicular morphology. This advancement paved the way for translating fucoxanthin into a clinically effective anti-obesity agent.",2025,"['leptin', 'monocyte chemoattractant protein 1', 'mcp - 1']","['leptin', 'monocyte chemoattractant protein 1']"
Variation in cardiovascular risk marker profile in treated diabetes mellitus patients with different body composition.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite treatment, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity is a separate risk factor of insulin resistance and CVD. The adipokine adipsin links adiposity, insulin resistance and inflammation. Heart type fatty acid binding protein (FABP3) protects against metabolic syndrome. Previously, the link between adipsin and FABP3 with body composition in diabetes patients on treatment has not been addressed. Therefore, in the present study, we have compared the levels of FABP3, adipsin, and their association with inflammation and body composition in T2D patients with high and normal BMI based on the Asian criteria of obesity.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Adipsin and FABP3 were estimated by ELISA. Body composition was digitally recorded in Department of Physiology. Comparison was done by one-way-ANOVA against healthy controls.<h4>Results</h4>Adipsin and TNF α were significantly increased, while FABP3 was decreased in high BMI T2D than healthy control. Normal BMI T2D had significant central obesity which explains their higher adipsin level.<h4>Conclusion</h4>T2D patients exhibit different CVD risk profile linked to different levels markers such as adipsin and FABP3. This is explained better by the difference in body fat distribution compared to BMI alone. The treatment should target improvement based on new markers and body composition.",2025,"['insulin', 'adipsin', 'insulin', 'heart type fatty acid binding protein', 'fabp3', 'adipsin', 'fabp3', 'fabp3', 'adipsin', 'adipsin', 'fabp3', 'adipsin', 'tnf α', 'fabp3', 'adipsin', 'adipsin', 'fabp3']","['insulin', 'adipsin', 'fabp3']"
Mechanistic insights into the Bushen Huatan Huoxue Formula and its components in ameliorating obesity-associated polycystic ovary syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bushen Huatan Huoxue Formula (BHHF), a traditional Chinese medicine decoction, demonstrates potential in treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age that is closely associated with obesity and metabolic dysregulation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of BHHF's action remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of BHHF in obesity-associated PCOS and investigate its regulatory mechanisms related to metabolic homeostasis.<h4>Methods</h4>In vivo, three-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into seven groups: control, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), high-fat diet (HFD), model (HFD + DHEA), low-dose BHHF, high-dose BHHF, and metformin. The PCOS model was induced by DHEA injection. BHHF was administered by gastric gavage for four weeks. Body weight, fat volume, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity were measured. Ovarian histology, hormone analysis, RNA extraction, quantitative real-time PCR, protein extraction, western blotting, and proteomics studies were also conducted. In vitro, 3T3-L1 cells were used to assess lipid accumulation, mitochondrial function, and the effects of BHHF-containing serum.<h4>Results</h4>BHHF restored reproductive cyclicity and polycystic ovarian morphology, reduced testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone levels, and increased estradiol levels. It also alleviated weight gain, reduced fat volume, improved glucose tolerance, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Proteomics analysis revealed that BHHF activated the AMPK signaling pathway and promoted white adipose tissue browning. In vitro, BHHF-containing serum suppressed lipid accumulation and enhanced mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The bioactive components of BHHF-Bushen (BS), Huatan (HT), and Huoxue (HX) -exhibited specific functions. BS improved estrous cyclicity and ovarian morphology; HT regulated glucose and lipid metabolism and promoted adipose browning; and HX modulated mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BHHF exerts multi-targeted therapeutic effects on obesity-associated PCOS by regulating metabolic-reproductive crosstalk. Its components act synergistically, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for PCOS treatment. Future research should focus on identifying core active compounds and optimizing treatment according to individual PCOS phenotypes.",2025,"['b', 'bhhf', 'bhhf', 'bhhf', 'insulin', 'b', '##f', 'insulin', 'bhhf', 'ampk', 'b']","['insulin', 'ampk']"
"Key Roles of Brown, Subcutaneous, and Visceral Adipose Tissues in Obesity and Insulin Resistance.","Adipose tissue is a dynamic and heterogeneous organ with distinct depots that play divergent roles in metabolic regulation. This review highlights the functional differences between brown, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue, and their contributions to obesity-related insulin resistance. We explore how chronic low-grade inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and fibrosis evolve within specific fat depots and how these changes disrupt systemic energy homeostasis. Visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) emerges as a critical site of inflammation and metabolic inflexibility, while subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) may retain protective features in early obesity. The endocrine roles of adipokines and batokines are also discussed, emphasizing depot-specific signaling and systemic effects. Furthermore, we examine emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune responses, enhancing mitochondrial function, and reprogramming adipose progenitor cells (APCs) to restore healthy tissue remodeling. A deeper understanding of adipose-depot-specific biology and progenitor cell dynamics offers promising avenues for personalized interventions in metabolic diseases.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
"Sedation-related adverse events in gastrointestinal endoscopy (CH-ESC study): study protocol for a prospective, observational cohort study in a Chinese tertiary hospital.","<h4>Background</h4>Sedation is commonly employed during gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE), yet sedation-related adverse events (SRAEs)-particularly cardiopulmonary complications-remain a critical safety concern. While large cohort studies from Western countries have identified key risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, and high ASA classification, data on SRAEs within the Chinese population are scarce. This study aims to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors associated with SRAEs in a Chinese tertiary hospital setting.<h4>Methods/design</h4>This prospective, observational cohort study is being conducted at the Changhai Digestive Endoscopy Center, one of the largest GIE facilities in China. Between November 2023 and November 2026, we aim to recruit 100,100 patients undergoing sedated GIE. The primary outcome is the incidence of SRAEs during the endoscopy procedure. Comprehensive data on patient demographics (e.g., age, BMI), sedation parameters (e.g., medications used, sedation depth), and endoscopic procedure specifics (e.g., type and duration) will be collected, and these candidate factors will be entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of SRAEs.<h4>Discussion</h4>With the increasing application of sedation during GIE, preventing and managing SRAEs is of paramount importance. The outpatient nature and short duration of these procedures complicate accurate reporting, potentially leading to an underestimation of SRAEs. Beyond established risk factors, this study seeks to explore emerging predictors, including waist-to-hip ratio and frailty assessments. Although this is a single-center study, it represents the first large-scale investigation of SRAEs in China and may contribute to improved risk stratification models and enhanced patient safety protocols.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2300078784. Registered on December 18, 2023.<h4>Study status</h4>Recruitment began on December 1, 2023.

MASLD: insights on the role of folate in hepatic lipid metabolism.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is also known as fatty liver disease associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a spectrum of chronic liver diseases characterized by steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and liver injury. The incidence and prevalence of MASLD is increasing rapidly worldwide. It is a multifactorial disease and there is no single drug approved for its treatment. The liver is the main organ that stores and metabolizes the B9 vitamin folate, which is synthesized mainly from dietary nutrients and intestinal microbiota and plays an important role in processes such as nucleic acid synthesis, methylation, and one-carbon metabolism (OCM). Serum folate levels are generally low in MASLD patients, and the low levels of endogenous folate lead to abnormalities in methionine metabolism and OCM, which disrupt lipid metabolism signaling pathways, and cause abnormalities in hepatic lipid metabolism, which may be related to the occurrence of metabolic disorders such as MASLD. Target folate may have beneficial effects in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism through regulating methionine metabolism, OCM and DNA methylation, and signaling pathways. Though a handful of studies argue that folate supplementation had no effect on blood pressure and lipids in patients with metabolic diseases, majority suggest that folate has the potential to serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the development of MASLD and the onset of metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH). To date, further research is needed in MASLD to (a) establish the dose of folate as a treatment, (b) determine the duration of therapy, especially in individuals with metabolic diseases, and (c) test its benefit on the different component features of MASLD (hepatic fat, inflammation, and fibrosis).",2025,[],[]

The Impact of a 3-Month Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention on Psychological Flexibility and Depression.,"A significant portion of individuals with overweight or obesity seek behavioral weight loss, which aims to modify behaviors and habits related to diet, physical activity, and lifestyle and has been shown to result in clinically meaningful weight loss and improved cardiometabolic health. While the physical outcomes of behavioral weight loss are well documented, relevant psychological processes and mental health outcomes are less studied. This secondary analysis examined psychological flexibility in relation to depression change and weight change in adults (N = 508) with a body mass index greater than 25 enrolled in a 3-month automated behavioral weight loss intervention. Psychological flexibility was assessed using the Comprehensive Assessment of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Processes (CompACT), a tool based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) principles. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative Depression-Short Form, which collects information directly reported by patients, was used to measure levels of depression. Change in psychological flexibility was found to significantly moderate the positive relationship between weight change and change in depression over the course of a 3-month behavioral weight loss intervention, such that individuals with greater increases in psychological flexibility experienced greater reductions in depression levels when also losing weight. These results suggest that psychological flexibility may enhance the psychological benefits of behavioral weight loss and could be a useful target in a modified version of behavioral weight loss intervention.",2025,[],[]
Meaningful Movement: Understanding and Accessing Physical Activity Among People with Severe Mental Illness - A Photovoice Study.,"People with severe mental illness are less physically active than the general population and face higher risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore how people with severe mental illness understand physical activity and what barriers and facilitators they experience. Using the methods of photovoice and co-creation, we engaged people with severe mental illness as co-researchers. The data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. The method enabled participants to reconceptualise physical activity, thereby highlighting it as a socially embedded practice. A photovoice exhibition showcased our result and gave voice to the target group. The overarching theme of 'Meaningful Movement' described the ways in which physical activity is part of daily life, emotional well-being, embodied experience, social belonging and identity. Two themes, 'Interaction with Other People' and 'Interaction with Nature and Animals', showed the ways in which access to physical activity is shaped by complex environmental interactions. The participants described limited access to nature, animals, and nuanced understandings of physical activity during psychiatric hospitalisation. These structural barriers limit opportunities for people with severe mental illness to engage in physical activity and constrain professionals in providing person-centred care.",2025,[],[]
"Sarcospan, a candidate gene of fat distribution, may affect lipid storage in adipocytes.","<h4>Background and aims</h4>Genetic and epigenetic variations in the Sarcospan (SSPN) gene are associated with parameters of fat distribution (body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio), glucose homeostasis and adipocyte size in human potentially by affecting adipogenesis. This study aims at clarifying the impact of SSPN on adipogenesis, particularly focusing on its promoter methylation.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Immortalized murine epididymal preadipocytes were transfected with fluorescence-marked plasmids coding for DNMT3a, CRISPR/dCas9-Suntag and vectors carrying guide RNAs complementary to the transcription start site region and differentiated to mature adipocytes. We performed siRNA-mediated Sspn knockdown in epididymal preadipocytes, measured target DNA methylation using pyrosequencing and quantified transcriptional changes of Sspn and adipogenic genes by qPCR. Additionally, we correlated SSPN mRNA values and clinical characteristics from a large human adipose tissue biobank (Leipzig Obesity Biobank).<h4>Results</h4>Epigenetic editing of the Sspn regulatory region in preadipocytes resulted in a significant increase (up to 35 %) in DNA promoter methylation throughout adipocyte differentiation but showed only minor effects on Sspn expression and fat storage. Though siRNA knockdown could also not contribute to understand the role of Sspn in a 2D adipogenesis model, large-scale correlation analyses still indicate the gene to be a key player in fat distribution and glucose homeostasis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the epigenetic downregulation of Sspn showed only marginal effects on adipogenesis, associations of SSPN expression in human adipose tissue with parameters of fat distribution and glucose homeostasis make it a promising candidate for further studies addressing metabolic processes in adipose tissue.",2025,"['sarcospan', 'sspn', 'sspn', 'dnmt3a', 'crispr', 'dcas9', 'sun', 'sspn', 'sspn', 'sspn mrna', 'sspn regulatory region', 'sspn', 'sspn', 'sspn', 'sspn']","['sarcospan', 'sspn', 'dnmt3a', 'crispr']"
Advancements in the understanding of mechanisms of the IL-6 family in relation to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease.,"As lifestyle patterns change, the rates of type 2 diabetes and obesity are increasing together, leading to an increase in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), now recognized as the most frequently occurring liver disease globally. MAFLD presents a significant threat to public health and imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden. This condition encompasses a spectrum of hepatic manifestations, beginning with excessive fat accumulation and hepatic steatosis, and possibly progressing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. The pathogenesis of MAFLD is intricately linked to lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity. Notably, the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family plays a complex role in the onset and development of MAFLD, primarily through the modulation of lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, inflammatory responses, and liver fibrosis.

The Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Its Macrovascular Complications.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is among the most common non-infectious causes of death globally, with Type 2 DM (T2DM) representing the majority of cases. T2DM is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Rapid changes in lifestyle, technological advancement, and societal evolution have fueled a global rise in T2DM, making it a major public health concern. The condition is associated with numerous complications-both macrovascular and microvascular-including coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetic retinopathy, all of which contribute to increased morbidity and early mortality. Chronic tissue inflammation is now recognized as a key factor in the development of T2DM, with elevated inflammatory markers serving as predictors of the disease. In particular, the NLRP3 inflammasome complex has emerged as a central player in this inflammatory process. NLRP3 acts as an intracellular sensor for danger signals and tissue injury, triggering inflammatory responses and contributing to endothelial dysfunction and T2DM pathogenesis. Its role in linking metabolic stress to inflammation has positioned it as a promising therapeutic target. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its role in T2DM and related vascular complications.

"Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of Parents Towards Obesity in Children in Aseer Region, Southern of Saudi Arabia.","<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity represents a critical global health concern, with steadily rising prevalence and significant implications for long-term physical and psychological well-being. In Saudi Arabia, the problem is particularly acute, with national data showing high obesity rates among children and adolescents, attributed to sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary habits. Understanding parental influence is vital in addressing this growing epidemic.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of parents regarding childhood obesity in the Aseer Region of Saudi Arabia and to identify demographic factors associated with parental knowledge levels.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted for a period of 3 months targeting parents of children aged 18 or younger years living in the Aseer Region. A structured questionnaire assessed sociodemographic data and parental KAP regarding childhood obesity. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests analyses were used for data analysis, with significance set at p < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 907 parents participated. While 92.8% recognized that children can be obese and 96.8% acknowledged lack of physical activity as a risk factor, only 67% were familiar with Body Mass Index (BMI), and 80.6% identified genetics as a contributing factor. Despite generally positive attitudes 93.5% agreed that high intake of sweets and fried foods increases obesity risk unhealthy practices were prevalent: 85.1% of children snacked between meals, 73.8% ate while using screens, and 48.7% exceeded three hours of screen time daily. Maternal education (p = 0.001) and employment status (p = 0.048) were significantly associated with higher parental knowledge levels. Positive correlations were also found between knowledge, attitude, and practice scores (p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although parents in the Aseer Region demonstrated high awareness and favorable attitudes, their practices often failed to reflect this knowledge. These findings highlight the need for culturally tailored interventions that support parents in translating awareness into healthier behaviors for their children. Strategies should particularly focus on screen time management, mindful eating, and support for less-educated and non-working mothers.",2025,[],[]
Metabolic and molecular regulation in skeletal muscle dysfunction and regeneration.,"Skeletal muscle is an important organ in the human body for maintaining overall strength and mobility.

Non-targeted metabonomics compared the spectrum of different metabolites in different groups of experimental mice, and targeted metabonomics examined the target metabolite in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). VAT transcriptomics identified differentially expressed genes. Multi-mics joint analysis identified target metabolites, genes, and their relationships. Functional annotation revealed shared signaling pathways. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with metabolites to observe changes in morphology, mitochondrial function, and expression of key genes in the signal pathway. The gene knockdown experiment evaluated the changes in key metabolites in the above functions of cells. Molecular docking predicted metabolite-protein binding sites. The results showed that 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) was significantly elevated in the HPRFD group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Fecal MTA negatively correlated with TST gene of VAT expression (<i>r</i> = -0.90/-0.89). KEGG analysis showed co-enrichment in apoptosis pathways. HPRFD upregulated TST (1.31-fold), Bak (6.52-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and Casp-3 (2.35-fold, <i>p</i> < 0.05) versus HFD. In vitro, 400 μmol/L MTA increased mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 ratio +0.13, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and upregulated TST, Bak, and Casp-3. The effect of MTA in restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and promoting the expression of Bak and Casp-3 genes disappeared after TST knockdown. Molecular docking predicted strong MTA-TST binding (Δ<i>G</i> = -1.2 kcal/mol). HPRFD reduced VAT through MTA-TST-Bak/Casp-3 axis, suggesting that MTA has the potential to be developed as a functional substance for obesity prevention and control.",2025,"['v', 'tst gene', 'v', 'tst', '##ak', 'casp - 3', 'tst', 'bak', 'casp - 3', 'bak', 'casp - 3 genes', 'tst', 'mta - tst', 'mta - tst', 'bak', 'casp -']","['tst', 'bak']"
"TOX4 Inhibition in Chronic Hyperglycemia: Effects on Glycation Stress, Hepatic Protection, Epigenetic Mechanisms, Signaling Pathways, and Beta Cell Dynamics.","TOX high mobility group box family member 4 (TOX4) has emerged as a critical regulator of Hepatic Glucose Production (HGP), particularly under insulin-resistant condi-tions seen in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Hyperglycemia-induced formation of Ad-vanced Glycation End products (AGEs) exacerbates metabolic dysfunction. While the Akt-FoxO1 axis has been the conventional focus of insulin signaling, recent findings highlight the upregulation of TOX4 in T2DM, obesity, and preclinical models (e.g., db/db mice). The cAMP signaling pathway has been shown to modulate TOX4 expression. This review syn-thesizes findings from recent in vivo and in vitro studies investigating the role of TOX4 in hepatic metabolism. The study focuses on its regulatory mechanisms, interaction with insu-lin signalling pathways, and its modulation through pharmacological inhibition. TOX4 in-hibition significantly reduces glucose output in hepatocytes and improves glucose tolerance in animal models. While TOX4 ablation fails to reverse metabolic impairments caused by insulin receptor knockout, it nonetheless attenuates hepatic glucose production under insu-lin-resistant states. Additionally, TOX4 suppression shows hepatoprotective effects and may offer potential neuroprotection in the context of diabetic complications. TOX4 represents a promising therapeutic target for managing T2DM and its comorbidities. Further investiga-tion into selective TOX4 inhibitors and their long-term safety profiles could facilitate the development of adjunct therapies for metabolic disorders involving hepatic and neuronal dysfunction.",2025,"['tox high mobility group box family member 4', 'tox4', 'insulin', 'akt', 'foxo1', 'insulin', 'tox4', 'tox4', 'tox4', 'insu - lin', 'tox4', 'tox4', 'insulin receptor', 'insu - lin', 'tox4', 'tox4', 'tox4']","['tox high mobility group box family member 4', 'tox4', 'insulin', 'akt', 'foxo1', 'insulin receptor']"

MAFLD: A Comprehensive Review of the Link Between Metabolic Dysfunction and Cardiovascular Risk.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) affects over 30% of the global population. It is a multisystem condition with a strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Key shared mechanisms, including insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and genetic predisposition, couple MAFLD with increased risks of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure. Early detection via non-invasive imaging and biomarkers is crucial for effective risk stratification. Management strategies emphasize lifestyle modifications and the development of targeted pharmacotherapies addressing metabolic and inflammatory pathways. Understanding the interconnected pathogenic mechanisms facilitates personalized interventions to reduce morbidity and improve long-term outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach remains essential to prevent and manage the cardiovascular implications of MAFLD.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Integrating digital health into pediatric obesity management: Current practices and future perspectives.,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood obesity is a growing global health concern with significant cardiometabolic consequences. While conventional treatment approaches often fail to achieve sustained outcomes, emerging digital health interventions (DHIs)-including mobile applications, educational video games, wearable devices, telemedicine, and social media-offer innovative tools to support lifestyle modifications and enhance therapeutic adherence.<h4>Methods</h4>In this narrative review, we focus on the main evidence regarding the effectiveness of DHIs for pediatric obesity treatment according to target (children vs. children with families) and duration (short- and long-term interventions). We also review their impact on clinical (e.g. body mass index, body composition, etc.), behavioral (physical activity, nutrition, adherence) and psychosocial (motivation, engagement) outcomes. In addition, future trends in the field are also discussed.<h4>Results</h4>DHIs demonstrate short-term effectiveness, especially when they incorporate personalization, interactivity, and family involvement. Mobile applications and educational video games boost nutritional literacy and promote healthy behaviours. Wearable devices encourage physical activity awareness, though adherence often varies. Long-term, family-based interventions help reduce dropout rates and reinforce lasting healthy habits. Guided use of social media can facilitate health education but also exposes users to risks such as misinformation and unhealthy food marketing. Despite these advancements, DHIs still face major challenges, including unequal access, data privacy concerns, and a lack of long-term outcome evaluations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity underscores the urgent need for effective and sustainable treatment strategies. DHIs represent a promising, scalable approach for managing childhood obesity, but their long-term sustainability and effectiveness remain to be fully established. Ongoing technological advancements-and their thoughtful integration into existing healthcare frameworks-present significant opportunities to develop innovative, patient-centered therapeutic solutions that can improve engagement, adherence, and long-term health outcomes in children and adolescents with obesity.",2025,[],[]
TWEAK/Fn14 hypomethylation and higher plasma TWEAK and TNF-α levels are related to sarcopenic obesity in community-dwelling elderly in Xinjiang.,"Sarcopenic obesity is a primary factor contributing to the decline in the quality of life among the elderly in our country. Studies have shown that hypomethylation of tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)/fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is associated with sarcopenia. Our research primarily explores whether this mechanism also affects the progression of sarcopenic obesity. A total of 120 subjects were grouped into the case (sarcopenic obesity) and control (non-sarcopenic and nonobese) groups, with 60 subjects in each group based on power test (medium effect size, power = 80%). Bisulfite sequencing was used to assess the methylation status of TWEAK/Fn14 in these subjects. ELISA was employed to measure the plasma concentrations of TWEAK, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and IL-10. SPSS 17.0 and R software was used for statistical analysis, employing multiple logistic regression to adjust for residual confounding factors, and Student t tests for difference analysis. Compared to the case group, the control group had higher methylation levels at CpG20, CpG30 sites in TWEAK (P = .043 for both). Additionally, the control group showed higher methylation level at CpG25 site in Fn14 (P = .025). After adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, triglyceride levels, gender, and age, Student t tests covariance confirmed significant differences in the enrichment levels of TWEAK, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-4 of patients in case group (PTWEAK = .017, PTNF-α < .001, PIL-10 = .010, PIL-4 = .016). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that higher plasma levels of TWEAK and TNF-α were significantly associated with the incidence of sarcopenic obesity (odds ratios = 1.024, 95% confidence interval = 1.006-1.042; odds ratios = 2.537, 95% confidence interval = 1.697-3.793). This evidence suggested that hypomethylation of TWEAK/Fn14 also affected sarcopenic obesity progression. Increased enrichment of TWEAK and TNF-α in plasma, along with hypomethylation of TWEAK and Fn14, promotes the occurrence of sarcopenic obesity may affect occurrence of sarcopenic obesity.",2025,"['tumour necrosis factor - like weak inducer of apoptosis', 'tweak', 'fibroblast growth factor - inducible 14', 'fn14', 'tweak', 'fn14', 'tweak', 'tumour necrosis factor - alpha', 'tnf - α', 'interleukin ( il ) - 4', 'il - 6', 'il - 10', 'cpg20', 'cpg30 sites', 't', '##ak', 'cpg25 site', 'fn14', 'tweak', 'tnf - α', 'il - 10', 'il - 4', '##tweak', 'p', '##tnf - α', 'pil - 10', 'pil - 4', 'tweak', 'tnf - α', 'tweak', 'fn14', 'tweak', 'tnf - α', 'tweak', 'fn14']","['tweak', 'fn14']"
The relation between body mass index and target organ damage and the mediating role of blood pressure.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>The relationship between obesity and blood pressure (BP) is well known, but limited data exists regarding its relationship with target organ damage (TOD). Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and TOD and the mediating role of BP.<h4>Subjects/methods</h4>2555 adults (52.0% women) who visited a local Hypertension Unit with valid measures on weight, height, 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring, office BP measurements, echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography and blood creatinine levels, included in this cross-sectional study. BMI was used to categorize participants as having normal weight (< 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obesity (≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common (CCA) and the internal (ICA) carotid artery, left ventricular mass (LVM), LVM index (LVMI) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were estimated and used as TOD indices. Linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between obesity and BP measurements or TOD, while structural equation modeling (SEM) for mediation analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Obesity was significantly related to 24-hour systolic BP (b = 3.72, 95%CI: 2.24-5.21, p < 0.001), CCA-IMT (b = 0.04, 95%CI: 0.02-0.05, p < 0.001), ICA-IMT (b = 0.03, 95%CI: 0.01-0.05, p = 0.020), and LVMI (b = 7.54, 95CI%: 4.25-10.83, p < 0.001). The mediation analysis revealed that 24-hour systolic BP mediated by 27.9% the relationship between BMI and CCA-IMT, by 31.3% the relationship between BMI and ICA-IMT, and by 18.1% the relationship between BMI and LVMI.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results indicate that obesity is associated with indices of asymptomatic cardiac remodeling and vascular atherosclerosis, and systolic BP mediates these relationships.",2025,['ica - imt'],[]
"High-intensity interval training prevents high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis by modulating miRNA-34a, miRNA-467b, and their primary target proteins in male rats.","<h4>Aims</h4>High-fat diet (HFD) consumption contributes to obesity and liver damage, while exercise training may counteract these effects. Given the regulatory role of microRNAs in lipid metabolism, this study investigates the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and HFD on hepatic fat accumulation, as well as the expression of miRNA-34a, miRNA-467b, and their associated proteins.<h4>Main methods</h4>Twenty-four male rats were randomly assigned to four groups: (1) CON, (2) HIIT, (3) HFD, and (4) HIIT+HFD. The HFD groups received a 60% fat diet, while the rats in the HIIT groups performed high-intensity interval training (3 sessions/week, 2.5 minutes high-intensity running × 90% maximal running capacity (MRC) with 2.5 minutes active rest × 50% MRC, for ten weeks). Forty-eight hours post-intervention, blood and liver samples were collected to assess histopathology, liver enzymes, and the expression of miRNA-34a, miRNA-467b, SIRT1, PPAR-ɑ, and LPL proteins.<h4>Key findings</h4>The HFD group exhibited excessive hepatic lipid accumulation, whereas HIIT significantly prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, as confirmed by histopathological examinations. Liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT, and ALP) were significantly higher in the HFD group and significantly lower in both the HIIT and HIIT+HFD groups. Additionally, HIIT significantly increased miRNA-467b, SIRT1, and PPAR-ɑ expression while significantly decreasing miRNA-34a and LPL expression, preventing the effects of HFD.<h4>Significance</h4>Our findings identified a novel molecular mechanism confirming that HIIT is beneficial to prevent hepatic steatosis and hepatic damage induced by HFD, likely due to the modulation of miRNA-467b, miRNA-34a, and their main target proteins.",2025,"['mirna - 34a', 'mirna - 467b', 'mirna - 34a', 'mirna - 467b', 'sirt1', 'ppar - ɑ', 'lpl proteins', 'ast', 'alt', 'alp', 'mirna - 467b', 'sirt1', 'ppar - ɑ', 'mirna - 34a', 'lpl', 'mirna - 467b', 'mirna - 34a']","['sirt1', 'ast', 'alt', 'alp', 'lpl']"
The role of β-hydroxybutyrate testing in ketogenic metabolic therapies.,"Accurate assessment of dietary adherence and metabolic outcomes remains a critical challenge in most nutrition studies. Ketogenic metabolic therapies (KMTs) provide a unique advantage by inducing nutritional ketosis and enabling the use of ketone bodies as biomarkers of metabolic state. This narrative review investigates the role of ketone testing as an integral component of KMTs. We introduce the key biomarkers and testing modalities currently used and present a comprehensive overview of the use of capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) testing across diverse therapeutic areas. Capillary blood BHB testing plays a multifaceted role in KMTs: it enables objective monitoring of dietary adherence, supports the interpretation of clinical outcomes, and informs personalized treatment adjustments based on individual metabolic responses. Additionally, it may facilitate behavior change through real-time feedback. Broader implementation of ketone testing in both clinical and research settings will require thoughtful protocol design that accounts for individual preferences and tolerability, continued technological innovation to enhance user experience, and further research into the relationship between ketone levels and therapeutic outcomes.",2025,[],[]
"Exome-wide association study in 54,698 south Asians identifies novel type 2 diabetes associations with <i>RNF19A</i>, <i>HNF4A</i>, and dissects role of coding variants in GP2 and <i>CDKAL1</i>","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects individuals of South Asian ancestry, yet the underlying genetic aetiology remains poorly understood and in genetic studies these populations remain underrepresented. We conducted an exome-wide association study (ExWAS) in 13,674 T2D cases and 41,024 controls of British-Bangladeshi and -Pakistani ancestry from the Genes & Health study, focusing on damaging coding variants in single-variant and gene-level analyses. This represents the largest ExWAS of T2D to date. We tested the association of novel genes and variants with metabolic traits in Genes & Health, UK, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation Biobank, India (MDRF), and the UK Biobank. Gene-level analyses revealed novel associations with RNF19A (p = 1.8×10⁻¹□) and HNF4A (p = 2.4×10⁻¹³), a known monogenic diabetes gene. The HNF4A signal was driven by a South Asian-specific gain-of-function variant (rs150776703, Pro437Ser) protective against T2D (OR = 0.48, p = 2.8×10⁻ ¹□), diabetic eye disease, and gestational diabetes but associated with elevated LDL-cholesterol, plasma PCSK9 upregulation, and increased myocardial infarction risk (HR = 1.62, p = 0.01). In Huh7 cells, Pro437Ser demonstrated similar transactivation of HNF4A target, G6PC , compared to wild-type, partially explaining the protective effect for T2D. Single-variant analyses highlighted a missense variant in CDKAL1 and a T2D risk-increasing South Asian-specific variant, rs78193826 ( GP2 Val429Met), linked to CKD risk and beta-cell dysfunction (via stimulated C-peptides). Meta-analysis with UK Biobank highlights a role for plasma GP2 levels as a biomarker for high genetic risk of beta-cell deficiency and low risk for obesity-mediated T2D.

Targeting the endocannabinoid system to suppress mTORC1 hyperactivation in TSC-associated kidney disease.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) promotes renal cyst formation and chronic kidney disease through mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) dysregulation, yet effective treatments remain limited. Using mouse models with <i>Tsc1</i> deletion in nephron progenitor cells and CRISPR-edited human kidney cells, we assessed the role of the endocannabinoid system in TSC-associated kidney disease. <i>Tsc1</i> deletion led to significant alterations in endocannabinoid levels and the expression of metabolizing enzymes. These molecular changes were accompanied by receptor dysregulation, characterized by CB1R upregulation and CB2R downregulation in cyst-lining epithelial cells. A similar receptor imbalance was observed in <i>TSC1</i>-deficient human kidney cells, suggesting a conserved pathogenic mechanism. Treatment with the peripheral CB1R antagonist JD5037 significantly reduced mTORC1 activity and c-Myc expression in cultured cells and ex vivo kidney organ cultures. These findings identified CB1R as a potential therapeutic target, linking endocannabinoid dysregulation to TSC kidney pathology.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This study reveals for the first time that TSC-associated kidney disease involves significant dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system in both murine models and human kidneys, characterized by altered endocannabinoid levels, enzyme expression changes, CB1R upregulation, and CB2R downregulation in cyst-lining epithelial cells.

Impact of ultra-processed foods on hedonic and homeostatic appetite regulation: A systematic review.,"The rapid rise in ultra-processed foods (UPF) consumption correlates with the growing global obesity prevalence. Investigating the hedonic and homeostatic mechanisms affected by UPF may provide insights for obesity prevention and appetite regulation. This systematic review aimed to examine the current understanding of the potential effects of UPF on appetite regulation and food intake, examining both hedonic and homeostatic pathways. A search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases, and studies published in English language were selected. Study selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria were determined based on PECOS framework. The quality of the studies was evaluated using appropriate Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and all articles were found to have low risk of bias. Of the 11 studies included, three were randomized controlled trials, one was cross-over study, one was non-randomized controlled study, and six were observational studies. Results indicated that UPF consumption may influence to hedonic appetite by promoting faster eating rates, enhancing palatability, activating brain reward circuits, and potentially increasing food addiction behaviors. Additionally, UPF intake may disrupt homeostatic appetite regulation by altering gut-brain axis signaling and modulating peripheral peptides such as ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP, and PYY. However, findings on both hedonic and homeostatic mechanisms remain inconclusive due to heterogeneous study designs, general characteristics of participants, and varying baseline UPF intake. These findings suggest that reducing UPF consumption could be a relevant target for appetite and weight management strategies, highlighting the need for more mechanistic and longitudinal research.",2025,"['ghrelin', 'glp - 1', 'gip']","['ghrelin', 'glp 1', 'gip']"

At different time points (0 to 12 weeks), the survivability and body weight (BW) of zebrafish were measured, while various biochemical and histological evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of feeding the respective diets. Additionally, an in silico approach was used to assess the binding interactions of MO phytoconstituents with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. <b>Results</b>: Following 12-week supplementation, higher zebrafish survivability was observed in the MO-supplemented groups compared to the survivability of the HCD group. Relative to the initial BW, only 4% BW enhancement was observed post 12 weeks of dietary intake of 1.0% MO, in contrast to 27% BW gain in the HCD group. MO supplementation at both (0.5% and 1.0%) effectively mitigates the HCD-induced dyslipidemia and significantly minimizes the atherogenic coefficient and atherogenic index. Similarly, MO reduces elevated blood glucose levels, the ALT/AST ratio, and augments ferric ion reduction (FRA) and paraoxonase (PON) activity in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, MO (particularly at 1.0%) effectively restrained HCD-induced steatosis, hepatic interleukin (IL)-6 production, and protected the kidneys, testes, and ovaries from oxidative stress and cellular senescence. The in silico findings underscore that the six phytoconstituents (chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin, kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-rutinoside, astragalin, apigetrin, and myricetin) of MO exhibited a strong interaction with HMG-CoA reductase active and binding site residues via hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. <b>Conclusions</b>: The findings demonstrated an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic effect of MO, guiding the events to prevent HCD-induced metabolic stress and safeguard vital organs.",2025,"['3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme a ( hmg - coa ) reductase', 'paraoxonase', 'pon', 'he', '##patic interleukin ( il ) - 6', 'hmg - coa reductase']","['paraoxonase', 'pon', 'hmg coa reductase']"
Integrated Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals the Regulatory Mechanism of Peanut Skin Procyanidins on Lipid Metabolism in High-Fat-Diet-Induced Obese Mice.,"<b>Background</b>: Obesity-associated metabolic disorders represent a critical global health challenge, which necessitates innovative strategies targeting lipid metabolism. Peanut skin procyanidins (PSPs), abundant bioactive compounds derived from agricultural by-products, show potential in lipid regulation, but molecular mechanisms remain unclear. <b>Methods</b>: This study integrated hepatic metabolomics, network pharmacology, and gut microbiota analysis to systematically decipher the mechanisms for PSP to ameliorate high-fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid metabolism disorders. <b>Results</b>: PSP intervention significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in LDL-C, TG, and TC levels and effectively mitigated hepatic lipid accumulation. Metabolomics revealed that PSP reshaped hepatic lipid dynamics by modulating glycerophospholipid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, tryptophan, and nitrogen metabolism. Subsequent network pharmacology identified <i>PLA2G10</i>, <i>PLA2G5</i>, <i>PLA2G2A</i>, and <i>CYP1B1</i> as the core targets, and PSP could markedly suppress their HFD-induced overexpression. Furthermore, PSP selectively reshaped the gut microbiota, enriching beneficial genera such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> while reducing the abundance of harmful bacteria within Firmicutes. PICRUSt-based functional prediction indicated that PSP alters gut microbial glutamine synthetase activity. <b>Conclusions</b>: Mechanistically, PSP regulates lipid metabolism by downregulating <i>PLA2G10</i>, <i>PLA2G5</i>, <i>PLA2G2A</i>, and <i>CYP1B1</i> expression, remodeling gut microbiota structure, and increasing hepatic glutamine level.

Use of Semaglutide for Successful Weight Loss and Maintenance in a Non-Obese Population: An Observational Study,"<h4>Objectives: </h4> This study aimed to assess the efficacy of compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient of an FDA-approved weight loss drug for patients with obesity, for weight loss in otherwise healthy, normal, and overweight individuals (BMI &lt; 29.9). Additionally, a novel method to declare the ideal or target weight—which bridges the differences in body composition, bone structure, and sex—is proposed. Achieving a target weight is also proposed as a measure of success for the weight loss program. <h4>Methods:</h4> An internal, prospective, non-randomized, dynamic cohort, observational study—Elective Weight Loss™—was the design adopted in this study. Weight was collected from 326 patients (male n = 23, female n = 303), with a mean age of 42.2 years, over 12 to 120 weeks. Weekly doses, dose adjustments, cessation of semaglutide, achievement of target weight, and weight maintenance were documented. No diet was prescribed. This is an ongoing, rolling database. <h4>Results:</h4> The results showed that 96% of the patients lost weight. Five patients gained weight, and seven lost no weight. In non-obese patients (n = 233), the mean starting BMI was 25.44 ± 2.6 (range: 20–28), and the mean end BMI was 22.99 ± 2.55 (p &lt; 0.001). Obese patients (n = 93) had a mean starting BMI of 34.98 ± 4.6 and a mean end BMI of 30.72 ± 4.98 (p &lt; 0.001). <h4>Conclusions:</h4> Compounded semaglutide was found to be a safe and highly effective off-label option for elective weight loss in normal and overweight individuals. It promotes weight loss at lower doses and shows potential benefits comparable to moderate calorie restriction in improving cardiometabolic health and supporting anti-aging in non-obese individuals.",2025,[],[]
E-Health and M-Health in Obesity Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of RCTs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity in adults is a growing health concern. The principal interventions used in obesity management are lifestyle-change interventions such as diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy. Although they are effective, current treatment options have not succeeded in halting the global rise in the prevalence of obesity or achieving sustained long-term weight maintenance at the population level. E-health and m-health are both integral components of digital health that focus on the use of technology to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes. The use of eHealth/mHealth might improve the management of some of these treatments. Several digital health interventions to manage obesity are currently in clinical trials.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of our systematic review is to evaluate whether digital health interventions (e-Health and m-Health) have effects on changes in anthropometric measures, such as weight, BMI, and waist circumference and behaviors such as energy intake, eating behaviors, and physical activity.<h4>Methods</h4>A search was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted through 4 October 2024 through three databases (Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus). Studies were included if they evaluated digital health interventions (e-Health and m-Health) compared to control groups in overweight or obese adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and reported anthropometric or lifestyle behavioral outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2). Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects or fixed-effects models as appropriate, with statistical significance set at <i>p</i> < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-two RCTs involving diverse populations (obese adults, overweight individuals, postpartum women, patients with eating disorders) were included. Digital interventions included biofeedback devices, smartphone apps, e-coaching systems, web-based interventions, and mixed approaches. Only waist circumference showed a statistically significant reduction (WMD = -1.77 cm; 95% CI: -3.10 to -0.44; <i>p</i> = 0.009). No significant effects were observed for BMI (WMD = -0.43 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>p</i> = 0.247), body weight (WMD = 0.42 kg; <i>p</i> = 0.341), or lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity (SMD = -0.01; <i>p</i> = 0.939) and eating behavior (SMD = -0.13; <i>p</i> = 0.341). Body-fat percentage showed a borderline-significant trend toward reduction (WMD = -0.79%; <i>p</i> = 0.068). High heterogeneity was observed across most outcomes (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> > 80%), indicating substantial variability between studies. Quality assessment revealed predominant judgments of ""Some Concerns"" and ""High Risk"" across the evaluated domains.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Digital health interventions produce modest but significant benefits on waist circumference in overweight and obese adults, without significant effects on other anthropometric or behavioral parameters. The high heterogeneity observed underscores the need for more personalized approaches and future research focused on identifying the most effective components of digital interventions. Digital health interventions should be positioned as valuable adjuncts to, rather than replacements for, established obesity treatments. Their integration within comprehensive care models may enhance traditional interventions through continuous monitoring, real-time feedback, and improved accessibility, but interventions with proven efficacy such as behavioral counseling and clinical oversight should be maintained.",2025,[],[]

However, the relationship between the gastric microbiota and obesity remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the composition of gastric microbiota, excluding <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, in relation to body mass index (BMI) and metabolic indicators.<h4>Methods</h4>Thirty participants undergoing health checkups were classified into three groups-normal weight (BMI 18.5-22.9), overweight (BMI 23.0-24.9), and obese (BMI ≥25.0)-with ten individuals per group. Those with <i>H. pylori</i> infection, atrophic gastritis, or intestinal metaplasia were excluded. Gastric microbiota from four antral biopsies per subject were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and functional profiling by metagenomic prediction.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Alpha diversity (Gini-Simpson index) was significantly lower in the combined overweight/obese group than that in the normal group (<i>P</i>=0.049). Beta diversity analysis revealed clear group separation (Bray-Curtis, <i>P</i>=0.005; unweighted UniFrac, <i>P</i>=0.004). Significant species differences between the groups were observed; specifically, the abundances of <i>Muribaculum gordoncarteri</i>, <i>Turicibacter bilis</i>, and <i>Duncaniella dubosii</i>, were significantly reduced in the overweight/obese group. Functional predictions showed differential enrichment of pathways related to fatty acid, amino acid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism across BMI categories. These findings suggest that alterations in the gastric microbiota may be linked to obesity and metabolic dysregulation.",2025,"['16', 'rrna']",['rrna']

"Nuclear receptors in metabolic, inflammatory, and oncologic diseases: mechanisms, therapeutic advances, and future directions.","Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to metabolic, hormonal, and environmental signals. These receptors play a critical role in metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, immune function, and disease pathogenesis, positioning them as key therapeutic targets. This review explores the mechanistic roles of NRs such as PPARs, FXR, LXR, and thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, energy expenditure, cardiovascular health, and neurodegeneration. The therapeutic landscape for NRs has expanded with the approval of drugs like PPARγ agonists (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) for diabetes, FXR agonists (obeticholic acid) for liver diseases, and selective TR agonists (resmetirom) for Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). However, challenges such as tissue-specific activation, drug resistance in chronic diseases, and potential carcinogenic risks continue to limit the full clinical efficacy of NR-targeted therapies. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including selective nuclear receptor modulators (SNRMs), dual and pan-NR agonists, and gene therapy approaches, aim to enhance receptor specificity while minimizing adverse effects. Furthermore, advances in artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, CRISPR-based gene therapy, and microbiome-targeted interventions hold significant promise for refining the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NR-based treatments. A deeper understanding of NR crosstalk with metabolic, inflammatory, and oncogenic pathways will be crucial for developing next-generation therapies to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve clinical outcomes. These advancements, combined with precision medicine approaches, are poised to revolutionize NR-targeted therapies, offering more precise, effective, and safer treatments for a range of metabolic, inflammatory, and oncological diseases.",2025,"['ppars', 'fxr', 'lxr', 'thyroid hormone receptors', 'thrs', 'pparγ', 'fxr', 'tr', 'n', 'nr']","['ppar', 'fxr', 'thyroid hormone receptor', 'thr', 'pparγ']"

Salivary Amylase Gene Copy Number Relates with BMI Z-Score and with Response to Lifestyle Intervention for Children with Overweight and Obesity.,"The prevalence of childhood obesity has risen significantly, with numerous associated health risks. Emerging research suggests a potential role for genetic factors; particularly, copy number variations (CNVs) of the <i>amylase 1</i> gene (<i>AMY1</i>) may influence obesity through dietary behavior and metabolic regulation. This study aimed to examine the relationship between BMI z-score, dietary intake, and salivary <i>AMY1</i> gene copy number (CN) in children with overweight and obesity, and to assess the relationship between <i>AMY1</i> CN and the impact of lifestyle intervention on these parameters. The study included 90 children aged 2-6 years with overweight or obesity. Participants were randomized into either a parent support intervention group or a standard care control group. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake, and salivary <i>AMY1</i> gene copy number were assessed at baseline and after a 9-month intervention. Positive correlations were found between <i>AMY1</i> gene copy number, BMI z-score, and carbohydrate intake, suggesting a potential role of this gene in dietary behavior-related obesity. The parent support intervention led to significant reductions in children's BMI, BMI z-score, and energy and macronutrient intake compared to standard care. Although there was no direct association between <i>AMY1</i> copy number and changes in BMI z-score, higher <i>AMY1</i> copy numbers were associated with greater reductions in polyunsaturated fatty acid intake. These findings highlight an interaction between salivary <i>AMY1</i> gene copy number, dietary intake, and obesity in children. These results support the relevance of genetic factors in obesity-related dietary patterns and emphasize the effectiveness of targeted family-based lifestyle interventions.",2025,"['amylase 1 <', 'amy1', 'amy1', 'amy1', 'amy1', 'amy1', 'amy1', 'amy1', 'amy1']",['amy1']
Obesity and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism via the Kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling pathway.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity exacerbates the severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), potentially through metabolic alterations. This study investigates how the Kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling pathway mediates mitochondrial energy metabolism in obesity-related CIN.<h4>Methods</h4>A clinical analysis of 980 samples was conducted to assess the correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and CIN grade. Transcriptomic analysis identified KISS1R as a key gene. Functional assays in cervical cancer (CC) cell lines, including CCK-8, wound healing, and Transwell assays, were used to evaluate the effects of KISS1 modulation. Mitochondrial function was assessed via oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) assays. A high-fat diet-induced CIN mouse model was used to investigate the in vivo effects.<h4>Results</h4>BMI positively correlated with CIN grade, with elevated KISS1R expression in higher CIN grades. Overexpression of KISS1 enhanced CC cell proliferation and migration by reprogramming mitochondrial energy metabolism. In high-fat environments, KISS1 silencing and mitochondrial activator PQQ modulated CC cell behavior. Activation of Kisspeptin/GPR54 in obese CIN mice exacerbated cervical lesions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Kisspeptin/GPR54 signaling pathway enhances mitochondrial energy metabolism, promoting obesity-related CIN grade. These findings provide a potential molecular mechanism linking obesity to CC and suggest new therapeutic targets.",2025,"['kisspeptin', 'gpr54', 'kiss1r', 'kiss1', 'kiss1r', 'kiss1', 'kiss1', 'pqq', 'kisspeptin', 'gpr54', 'kisspeptin', 'gpr54']","['kisspeptin', 'gpr54', 'kiss1r', 'kiss1', 'pqq']"
Role of Metabolic Abnormalities During the Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease and Preventive Strategies.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by persistent renal impairment or dysfunction that lasts for at least 3 months, and typically has a progressive and irreversible trajectory. The increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders, such as hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, have contributed to the increasing incidence of CKD, and it is now a significant public health concern worldwide. Accumulating evidence underscores the intricate relationships of the different metabolic disorders and how they promote the initiation and progression of CKD, and ultimately lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Metabolic abnormalities promote CKD progression by various mechanisms, including oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, dysregulation of autophagy, glomerular hyperfiltration and disruption of hemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Ectopic lipid deposition and lipid peroxidation-induced redox imbalance lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of the p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK signaling pathways. Metabolic dysregulation activates NF-κB signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasomes, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory factors, lysosomal dysfunction, and impaired autophagic clearance, followed by accumulation of metabolic waste and podocyte injury. Obesity and hyperlipidemia can cause excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which then causes glomerular hyperfiltration, endothelial and mesangial cell injury and proliferation, and ultimately glomerulosclerosis. Multiple interventions that target these mechanisms have shown therapeutic potential, and these include pharmacological treatments (xanthine oxidase inhibitors to reduce uric acid levels, statins for lipid regulation, and SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists to improve renal and cardiovascular outcomes), lifestyle interventions (low-salt and low-protein diets, weight management, smoking cessation, and alcohol limitation), intermittent fasting, and microbiome-targeted therapies. This review analyzes the pathways by which metabolic abnormalities affect the onset and progression of CKD, identifies strategies that have potential use for prevention or treatment, and offers a robust theoretical foundation for the future development of effective clinical interventions.",2025,"['p38', 'erk', 'jnk', 'nf - κb', 'n', '##lrp3', 'renin', 'angiotensin', 'aldostero', 'xanthine oxidase', 'statins', 's', '##glt2', 'glp - 1 receptor']","['p38', 'erk', 'jnk', 'renin', 'angiotensin', 'xanthine oxidase', 'statin', 'glp 1 receptor']"
Public Health Campaign to Prevent Dementia: An Unmet and Critical Need.,"This paper draws attention to the significant public health challenge that dementia represents in Australia as one of the leading causes of death and disease burden. In Australia alone, the number of people living with dementia is expected to double within 30 years. Evidence suggests that almost half of all dementia cases worldwide could be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors across the life course. With no effective medical treatment or cure for dementia, it stands to reason that economic investment should be directed towards preventing dementia and reducing risk by addressing modifiable risk factors at both individual and population levels. Attention must be afforded to the health inequities that exist, and consideration given to appropriate messaging and approaches to target the various cultural, commercial and social determinants of health associated with increased dementia risk across different population groups. Furthermore, critical messaging about dementia risk is largely absent from health campaigns, contributing to the low levels of understanding and awareness of dementia in the Australian public. Therefore, there is a need for urgent investment in a co-designed large-scale public health campaign targeting key modifiable risk factors for dementia to improve population brain health and reduce the societal impact of this condition.",2025,[],[]
Advances and challenges of targeting epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT).,"Clinical consensus statements have been issued for various adipose tissues (ATs), particularly regarding the diagnostic value of epicardial AT (EAT) and perivascular AT (PVAT) in cardiovascular disease. PVAT and EAT are promising targets for drug development and many drugs were also investigated, including DPP4 inhibitors, GLP-1R agonists, and SGLT-2i. Notably, DPP4 was the only gene that highly expressed in EAT and PVAT. DPP4 also reduced GLP-1 and its receptor GLP-1R expression, suggesting that DDP4 is a promising target for targeting EAT and PVAT. However, these preparations have poor specificity for PVAT and EAT. AT delivery strategies or specific AT genes, such as ADIPOQ and PHB1, may solve these problems. ADIPOQ is only expressed in AT and encodes adiponectin (ADPN). PHB1 is an AT vascular biomarker. Many ADPN and PHB1 agents have also been developed in preclinical and clinical trials. However, these agents have serious off-target effects. SaRNA, an RNA activation technology, may reduce off-target effects. Several saRNA agents were also developed in preclinical and clinical trials. Direct overexpression of ADIPOQ and PHB1 through saRNA in combination with extrahepatic delivery materials may be beneficial for drug development. This review focuses on recent advances targeting EAT and PVAT agents and identifies new therapeutic targets.",2025,"['eat', 'eat', 'dpp4', 'glp - 1r', 's', '##glt - 2i', 'dpp4', 'dpp4', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1r', 'ddp4', 'eat', 'eat', 'adipoq', 'phb1', 'adipoq', 'adiponectin', 'adpn', 'phb1', 'adpn', 'phb1', 'ad', '##oq', 'phb1', 'eat']","['dpp4', 'glp 1', 'adipoq', 'phb1', 'adiponectin', 'adpn']"
Physiological Mechanisms of and Therapeutic Approaches to the Gut Microbiome and Low-Grade Inflammation in Obesity.,"Obesity is a growing global health challenge, closely linked to chronic low-grade inflammation. This persistent, low-intensity immune response contributes to the development of metabolic, cardiovascular, and cancer-related diseases. A key player in this process is the gut microbiota. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut bacterial composition, disrupts metabolic function, weakens the intestinal barrier, and promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In people with obesity, gut microbial diversity is reduced, and the ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria shifts, affecting lipid metabolism and immune balance. Short-chain fatty acids, produced by gut bacteria, help maintain gut integrity and reduce inflammation. Butyrate, a major SCFA, also improves insulin sensitivity and may support obesity treatment. Diet plays a central role in shaping the gut microbiome. Western diets tend to promote dysbiosis and inflammation, while Mediterranean-style diets encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria. Targeted modulation of the microbiota through diet, probiotics, or medication emerges as a promising strategy for preventing and managing obesity.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Interaction of obesity and systemic inflammation with knee extensor strength in knee osteoarthritis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Knee osteoarthritis is accompanied by reduced muscle strength and a greater body mass index (BMI). Large BMI from accumulated fat mass is linked with greater systemic inflammation. Separate studies show inflammation is associated with reduced muscle strength in healthy adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether systemic inflammatory biomarkers interact with BMI to relate with knee extensor strength, and if the relationship differs based on sex.<h4>Methods</h4>93 participants with clinical knee osteoarthritis (n = 59 females, n = 34 males) were included. Knee extensor strength (Nm) was an average of 5 maximum voluntary isometric knee extension efforts. BMI was measured while barefoot, wearing a t-shirt and shorts. Serum cytokines were obtained from venous blood samples from the antecubital fossae following a 30-min rest period. Linear regressions tested the interaction effect of each CRP and IL-10 on the relationship between knee extensor strength (dependent variable) and BMI (independent variable), for both males and females.<h4>Findings</h4>Among females with a large BMI, higher levels of IL-10 related to greater knee extensor strength (t = 2.18, p = 0.03). For males, the interaction of IL-10 (t = 0.61, p = 0.55) with CRP (t = -1.75, p = 0.09) with BMI was not significant.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 may serve to balance the effect of an increased BMI in females by counteracting inflammation-induced muscle damage. Understanding this association provides insight into biological factors that may contribute to disease progression, serving as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.",2025,"['crp', 'il - 10', 'il - 10', 'il - 10', 'crp', 'il - 10']",['crp']
Predicting gut microbiota dynamics in obese individuals from cross-sectional data.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity affects approximately 39% of adults worldwide. While gut microbiota has been linked to obesity, most research has focused on static taxonomic composition rather than the dynamic interactions between microbial taxa.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied BEEM-Static, a generalized Lotka-Volterra model, to cross-sectional 16S rRNA gut microbiome data from six public datasets, comprising 2,435 profiles from lean and obese individuals.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 57 significant microbial interactions were identified in obese individuals (79% negative), compared to 37 in lean individuals (92% negative). For example, Bacteroidetes showed a stronger inhibitory effect on Firmicutes in obese individuals (-0.41) than in lean ones (-0.26). Firmicutes and Proteobacteria exhibited consistently higher carrying capacities in obese populations.<h4>Discussion</h4>These findings suggest that microbial interaction networks-not just taxonomic abundance-play a key role in obesity-related dysbiosis. Our approach enables the inference of microbiota dynamics from a single time point, paving the way for tailored dietary interventions, which we refer to as <i>Optibiomics</i>.",2025,[],[]
Regulatory effects of specialized metabolites from Dendrobium albosanguineum on lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation.,"The rising global incidence of obesity underscores the urgent demand for effective therapeutic interventions. Natural products have emerged as promising alternatives; however, identifying candidates that effectively target the complex mechanisms underlying obesity remains a critical challenge. In this study, the specialized metabolites of Dendrobium albosanguineum were investigated for their anti-obesity potential. Methanolic extraction was performed on the entire plant, followed by systematic fractionation and compound elucidation using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A set of in vitro colorimetric assays was employed to assess pancreatic lipase inhibition, cytotoxicity, intracellular lipid storage, triglyceride content, and glycerol release in murine (3T3-L1) and/or human (PCS-210-010) adipocyte models. In addition, flow cytometry, western blotting analysis, and RT-qPCR were used to evaluate the effects of a chosen metabolite on cell cycle progression and the expression of adipogenesis-related genes and proteins. Eight metabolites were isolated, including bibenzyls (moscatilin, chrysotoxine), lignans (syringaresinol, foliachinenoside C), a sterol (daucosterol), a phenylpropanoid (n-octacosyl-trans-p-coumarate), and flavonoids (rhoifolin, kaempferol-3-O-(2″,6″-dirhamnosyl)glucoside). Among them, foliachinenoside C exhibited the most potent activity, with 94.77 ± 0.85% inhibition of pancreatic lipase (IC<sub>50</sub> = 40.73 ± 0.74 µM). It significantly reduced triglyceride levels and promoted glycerol release in both murine and human adipocytes. Mechanistically, foliachinenoside C induced cell cycle arrest at the G0 phase in 3T3-L1 cells and downregulated key adipogenic transcription factors (PPARγ, C/EBPα, SREBP1c) and lipogenic proteins (FAS, PLIN1, LPL, ADPN, FABP4). Moreover, it modulated the AKT/GSK3β and AMPK-ACC signaling pathways, collectively suppressing adipocyte differentiation. These findings position foliachinenoside C as a promising plant-derived compound for obesity pharmacotherapy, warranting further investigation to facilitate its clinical development.",2025,"['pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pparγ', 'c / ebpα', 'srebp1c', 'fas', 'plin1', 'lpl', 'adpn', 'fabp4', 'akt', 'gsk3β', 'ampk', 'a']","['pancreatic lipase', 'pparγ', 'srebp1c', 'fas', 'plin1', 'lpl', 'adpn', 'fabp4', 'akt', 'gsk3β', 'ampk']"
"Targeting obesity, metabolic syndrome, and prostate cancer: GLP-1 agonists as emerging therapeutic agents.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is known as the second most common cancer and has one of the highest incidences among male cancers in the United States. In addition, obesity and metabolic syndrome are a rising and continuous issue in the United States, with 41.9% of individuals as obese. The importance of highlighting these figures is the possibility of PCa having a progressive relationship with obesity and metabolic syndromes. The drugs developed for treating obesity and diabetes pose an exciting possibility of therapeutic application for cancer in efforts to relieve the population's rising numbers. Although this connection has not been established in detail, there are some PCa key biomarkers, and their interactions with metabolic products found in obese, diabetic, and PCa patients can provide good starting points for further investigation. One of the significant links between PCa, obesity, and metabolic disease may be due to insulin metabolism. A downstream target identified that could be the link between PCa, metabolic syndromes, and obesity is the forkhead box C2 (FOXC2). FOXC2 has been known to inhibit some insulin-resistant genes and cause the proliferation of PCa. The relationships of FOXC2, insulin resistance, and GLP-1 receptor agonists as potential therapeutic applications have not been thoroughly explored. This review covers a broad relationship of PCa, obesity, metabolic syndromes, possible drugs, and therapeutic targets.",2025,"['insulin', 'forkhead box c2', 'foxc2', 'foxc2', 'insulin', 'foxc2', 'insulin', 'glp - 1 receptor']","['insulin', 'forkhead box c2', 'foxc2', 'glp 1 receptor']"

Pectin and Its Beneficial Effect on Health: New Contributions in Research and the Need to Increase Fruits and Vegetables Consumption-A Review.,"The beneficial effect of consuming fruits and vegetables in the prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases and healthy aging is well known. This is attributed to food and vegetable antioxidant and fiber content. The aim of this publication is to communicate the results of recent research on pectin in humans, to propose an increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, or their possible use as a food supplement. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted considering recent publications on pectin. The description of starch, pectin, the physicochemical changes caused by pectin, and the effect of pectin on the activity of amylase are reported. Dietary fiber and gut microbiota in human health are also described, with the production of saturated fatty acids with fewer than six carbon atoms. Finally, health effects such as anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic activities, preventing and controlling obesity and heart disease, are analyzed, as well as other health effects in tumors, the gastrointestinal tract, and immunity.

EV proteins were also analyzed 6 months after bariatric surgery in patients with obesity.<h4>Results</h4>We found 19 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in EVs between healthy controls and patients with obesity. In addition, 20 DEPs between patients with obesity who had and did not have diabetes were identified. After bariatric surgery, 14 DEPs mainly involved in the immune system were identified in patients with obesity and diabetes; adiponectin (ADIPOQ), mannose binding lectin 2 (MBL2), and hornerin (HRNR) were associated with glycemic control, body mass index, and weight loss, respectively. In patients with obesity without diabetes, 13 DEPs after bariatric surgery were predominantly involved in reactive oxygen species metabolism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Diabetes affects the differences in EV protein profiles in patients with obesity before and after bariatric surgery.

Feasibility and Tolerability of Nabilone for the Treatment of Obesity: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.,"<b>Introduction:</b> In epidemiological studies, people who use cannabis have a lower prevalence of obesity. Furthermore, the endocannabinoid system is recognized as a potential target for obesity treatment and partial agonism of the cannabinoid type-1 (CB<sub>1</sub>) receptor may reduce body weight. We thus hypothesized that 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy with the partial CB<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist nabilone would reduce body weight, relative to placebo, in adults with obesity. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial that investigated the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with nabilone compared with placebo in adults with obesity. Otherwise healthy adults aged 25-45 years with obesity were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three parallel treatment arms: high-dose nabilone (6 mg/day), low-dose nabilone (2 mg/day), or placebo. Safety and feasibility outcomes included adverse events (AEs), number of dropouts, and medication adherence per treatment arm. Efficacy outcomes included body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference. Secondary outcomes included gut microbiome changes, blood biomarkers (e.g., glucose and insulin levels), and mood. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 18 participants were randomized and 15 participants received at least one dose of drug (4 high-dose arm, 5 low-dose arm, 6 placebo). The trial was terminated early due to poor tolerability of the medication (e.g., all four participants allocated to high-dose nabilone withdrew due to AEs). Only eight participants completed per protocol (four in the low-dose arm and four in the placebo arm). Using data from completers only (<i>n</i> = 8), we saw a significant treatment effect on body weight (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and BMI (<i>p</i> < 0.001) that appeared to be driven by greater decreases in the low-dose arm (<i>n</i> = 4) relative to placebo (<i>n</i> = 4). Based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, the low-dose arm showed a greater change in the overall fecal microbiome composition compared with the placebo arm (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Discussion:</b> This pilot trial found poor tolerability of nabilone pharmacotherapy (especially at 6 mg/day) for adults with obesity who had not used any cannabinoid drugs for 6 months prior to enrolment.

CircGLIS3 Inhibits Intramuscular Adipogenesis and Alleviates Skeletal Muscle Fat Infiltration.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intramuscular fat (IMF) is a key determinant of meat quality. Excessive IMF deposition, commonly observed in human obesity and aging, negatively affects skeletal muscle function. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in muscle and fat development, as well as in the progression of related diseases. However, the specific functions and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in IMF deposition have not been extensively studied.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened adipogenic differentiation-related circRNAs using circRNA-seq combined with WGCNA. Functional analyses, including loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, were performed to determine the role of circGLIS3 in regulating adipogenesis in bovine intramuscular preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. A high-fat diet-induced mouse model was established to investigate the in vivo effects of circGLIS3 on skeletal muscle fat infiltration in mice (C57BL/6; n = 6 males). Mechanistic studies involved transcriptomic analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments.<h4>Results</h4>We screened and characterized a novel circRNA, circGLIS3, which is highly expressed in bovine IMF tissue and in the skeletal muscle of mice exhibiting fat infiltration. Functionally, circGLIS3 overexpression inhibited triglyceride synthesis (-16.19%, p < 0.01) and lipid droplet accumulation (-42.44%, p < 0.01) in intramuscular preadipocytes, concurrently downregulating the expression of key adipogenesis-related genes and proteins (p < 0.05). CircGLIS3 knockdown promoted triglyceride synthesis (+28.32%, p < 0.05) and lipid droplet accumulation (+47.40%, p < 0.01) in intramuscular preadipocytes, accompanied by a significant upregulation of adipogenesis-related genes and proteins (p < 0.05). Notably, circGLIS3 exhibits more than 80% sequence homology among bovine, mouse, and human species. CircGLIS3 overexpression inhibited triglyceride synthesis (-28.84%, p < 0.01) and lipid droplet accumulation (-46.49%, p < 0.01) in 3T3-L1 cells, concurrently downregulating the expression of adipogenesis-related genes and proteins (p < 0.05). Overexpression of circGLIS3 reduced skeletal muscle fat infiltration induced by high-fat diet in mice (-57.88%, p < 0.05). Mechanistically, circGLIS3 acts as a sponge for miR-21-3p, increasing the expression of its target gene, LEPR (+56.05%, p < 0.01), and promoting the phosphorylation level of its downstream signalling protein, AMPKα (+68.68%, p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CircGLIS3 inhibits bovine intramuscular adipogenesis by regulating the miR-21-3p/LEPR/AMPK axis, reducing fat infiltration in mouse skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that circGLIS3 is a promising target for improving meat quality in livestock, and as a potential therapeutic marker for alleviating skeletal muscle fat infiltration associated with obesity.",2025,"['wgcna', 'circglis3', 'circglis3', 'luciferase', 'circglis3', 'circglis3', 'c', '##ircglis3', 'circglis3', 'circglis3', 'circglis3', 'circglis3', 'mir - 21 - 3p', 'lepr', 'ampkα', 'circglis3', 'mir - 21 - 3p', 'lepr', 'ampk', 'circglis3']","['luciferase', 'lepr', 'ampkalpha', 'ampk']"
Vascular effects of perivascular adipose tissue-derived chemerin in obesity-associated cardiovascular disease.,"Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a unique and metabolically active adipose tissue that is adjacent to most systemic blood vessels. Healthy PVAT exerts anticontractile and anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to vascular protection. However, during obesity, PVAT becomes proinflammatory and profibrotic, exacerbating vascular dysfunction. Chemerin, a multifunctional adipokine, has emerged as a key regulator of vascular tone, inflammation, and remodeling. Although liver-derived chemerin dominates the circulating chemerin pool, PVAT-derived chemerin plays a more localized and functionally important role in vascular pathophysiology because of its proximity to the vessel wall. This review highlights the role of PVAT-derived chemerin in vascular health, the mechanistic involvement of PVAT-derived chemerin in certain aspects of obesity-associated cardiovascular diseases, and the therapeutic potential of targeting PVAT-derived chemerin.",2025,"['chemerin', 'chemerin', 'chemerin', 'pvat - derived chemerin', 'pvat - derived chemerin', 'pvat - derived chemerin', 'pvat - derived chemerin']",['chemerin']

The Combination of Fat Distribution and BMI Redefines Obesity: Result From NHANES.,"<h4>Background</h4>Body mass index (BMI) has well-recognized limitations, particularly in the context of the 'obesity paradox', where higher BMI does not consistently evaluate adverse outcomes. These limitations underscore the need for alternative approaches. This study aimed to redefine obesity using anthropometric indicators and to assess their prognostic value for mortality.<h4>Methods</h4>The original cohort included participants from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2006. Additional dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data on fat distribution were sourced from NHANES 1999-2006 and 2011-2018. Ten fat distribution indicators were adopted to assess the fat distribution in the target population, including five centripetal obesity indicators, three global obesity indicators and two limb obesity indicators. All-cause, cardiovascular-specific and cancer-specific mortality outcomes were examined using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate associations between fat distribution indicators and the prevalence of specific diseases.<h4>Results</h4>This study included 14 936 participants (weighted 152 823 236 participants, mean age: 45.56 ± 17.60 years) and two DXA-assessed cohorts. Fat distribution indicators were correlated with various DXA-defined fat components. All 10 indicators demonstrated significant associations with mortality. Notably, the relationship between centripetal obesity indicators and all-cause mortality was approximately linear in both sexes. Centripetal obesity was also strongly associated with cardiovascular and cancer-specific mortality (p < 0.001). Although fat distribution indicators were significantly linked to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), they showed no clear association with cancer incidence. Individuals with obesity but without centripetal fat accumulation exhibited a similar or slightly higher mortality risk compared with those with normal BMI and no centripetal obesity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Centripetal obesity indicators emerged as the strongest independent evaluators of mortality, regardless of BMI classification. These findings highlight the clinical value of incorporating fat distribution metrics alongside BMI to more accurately assess obesity-related mortality risk.",2025,[],[]

Differences in the insulin counterregulatory hormones between obese and nonobese male patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Obesity is associated with both high and low levels of hypoglycemia, and impairment of counterregulatory hormones may predispose individuals to hypoglycemia. This study aimed to explore differences in the responsiveness of insulin counterregulatory hormones to hypoglycemia between men with or without obesity who have been newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study enrolled 25 men newly diagnosed with T2DM who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism between January 2022 and December 2022. All participants were treated with intensive insulin pump therapy to achieve glycemic control within one week, then a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp was used to evaluate insulin counter-regulatory hormones for hypoglycemia. Based on the body mass index, 10 and 15 patients were included in the obese and nonobese groups, respectively. During the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp test, the obese group showed a significant lower multiple of adrenocorticotropic hormone elevation than the nonobese group (P = 0.040). Regarding the proportion of hormone response multiples reaching the target, those who reached the reaction multiple were lower in the obese group than those in the non-obese group, although the differences were not statistically significant (all P > 0.05). The responses of insulin counterregulatory hormones to hypoglycemia in men with obesity and newly diagnosed T2DM were significantly lower than those in men with T2DM but without obesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'adrenocorticotropic hormone', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'adrenocorticotropic hormone']"

Exploring the association between secondhand smoke exposure and hearing loss among U.S. nonsmokers.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure has been implicated as a risk factor for hearing loss. However, there is a relative paucity of inconsistent findings with limited frequency-specific details. The goal of this study is to better characterize the relationship between SHS exposure and hearing loss among adult nonsmokers in the U.S.<h4>Study design</h4>Cross-sectional.<h4>Setting</h4>2015-2016 NHANES cycle.<h4>Patients</h4>1644 nonsmokers between ages 20 and 69 and without diabetes, stroke, or heart disease.<h4>Intervention</h4>Serum cotinine level (ng/ml) indicated SHS exposure.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Outcomes were hearing thresholds at low-frequencies and high-frequencies as well as hearing loss defined by hearing threshold 20 dB in the better ear. Linear regressions between hearing thresholds and SHS exposure stratified by Body Mass Index (BMI) category and controlled for socio-demographic variables. Logistic regression modeling hearing loss by SHS exposure controlled for the same.<h4>Results</h4>SHS exposure was associated with elevated hearing thresholds at low-frequencies (β = 0.47, p = .03) only in the obese (BMI 30) population. SHS exposure was associated with greater odds of hearing loss (Odds Ratio: 1.17, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.06-1.29, p = .005) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While SHS exposure was associated with hearing loss and showed a dose-response relationship, its relationship with hearing thresholds was not demonstrated across all hearing frequencies or BMI categories. Additional research is needed to establish the clinical significance of these findings and clarify the role of obesity in this relationship.",2025,[],[]

The influence of prenatal exercise modes on resting maternal blood lactate.,"Resting lactate concentration in venous blood is a commonly used indicator of metabolic disease risk. Regular exercise during pregnancy improves maternal metabolic health; however, it is unknown if maternal exercise regulates resting lactate concentration. We aimed to elucidate the effects of three different modalities of exercise during pregnancy on blood lactate in pregnant women. This is a secondary analysis of data from three blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trials. Pregnant women were randomized to control or exercise. Exercisers underwent ~24 weeks of supervised aerobic, resistance, or combination exercise between 12-16 and 37-40 weeks gestation. Fasted resting maternal blood lactate was collected at 16 and 36 weeks of gestation. Although lactate increased 0.5 mmol/L in controls across gestation, this rise was blunted in exercisers (p = 0.01). Pre-pregnancy BMI was correlated with blood lactate in controls (p < 0.05, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.20) but not in exercisers (p > 0.05, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.01). Exercisers with overweight or obesity had lower 36-week lactate (p = 0.001), particularly in aerobic and combination (p = 0.03; p = 0.006, respectively). These findings show that exercise helps control the BMI-associated rise in maternal lactate seen in gestation and highlights the importance of exercise in women with overweight or obesity.",2025,[],[]
Endocrine complications after solid organ transplantation in childhood and adolescents.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Acute or chronic metabolic derangement following solid organ transplantation (SOT) often leads to endocrine complications, which have become more common as survival rates post-SOT have improved. This study was performed to investigate long-term endocrine complications after SOT in children and adolescents.<h4>Methods</h4>This study included 259 pediatric patients who underwent SOT, including kidney (n = 43), liver (n = 170), lung (n = 5), heart (n = 37), and multi-organ (n = 4), with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years post-transplant. Clinical and endocrinological data were retrospectively collected, including information on growth, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, thyroid disease, bone health, and pubertal development.<h4>Results</h4>Of 259 patients, 203 (78.4%) developed endocrine complications over a median follow-up period of 10.5 years (range, 5.5-16.8). Short stature was common in kidney (58.1%) and multi-organ recipients (100%), whereas the highest rates of obesity were observed in liver recipients (43.5%). Kidney or liver recipients under 13 years of age showed significant improvements in height-standard deviation scores within 5 years post-SOT. Discontinuation of corticosteroids was associated with a reduced risk of short stature 10 years after liver transplantation. Heart recipients had a high prevalence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM, 27%). Other endocrine complications included dyslipidemia (40.2%), hypothyroidism (2.8%), and low bone mineral density (31.3%). Among liver recipients, pretransplant obesity was a significant risk factor for development of post-transplant obesity, PTDM, and dyslipidemia. Additionally, liver transplantation at 0-1 years of age increased the risk of obesity, while transplantation at 6-12 years of age, cyclosporine use, and allograft rejection were associated with an increased risk of dyslipidemia.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study demonstrates that endocrine and metabolic complications are common in pediatric SOT recipients. Effective surveillance and management of these sequelae are crucial to improve long-term quality of life following SOT.",2025,[],[]

Trends and economic inequalities in obesity prevalence in Ghana: a cross-sectional study spanning 2008-2022.,"<h4>Background</h4>In Ghana, obesity is more prevalent among women. The adverse health outcomes associated with obesity echo the urgency for low-and-middle-income countries like Ghana to track the trends and identify economic inequalities in order to inform policy direction and interventions. Hence, this study examines the trends and economic inequalities in obesity prevalence among women in Ghana.<h4>Methods</h4>This study pooled data from the 2008 (n = 4899), 2014 (n = 4748) and 2022 (n = 7617) Ghana demographic and health survey data. Descriptive analysis as well as trend analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed. Erreygers Concentration Index (ECI) was used to estimate the economic inequalities in obesity prevalence.<h4>Results</h4>The findings suggest an increasing trend in the prevalence of obesity rising from 9.3% in 2008 to 18.8% in 2022. Year-to-year comparisons showed that the odds of obesity increased by 4.3% between 2008 and 2014 (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03-1.06), by 1.7% between 2014 and 2022 (OR = 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.03), and by 6.1% between 2008 and 2022 (OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.05-1.07). Economic status, as measured by wealth index, was significant with the richest women having nearly eight times higher odds of obesity compared to the poorest (AOR = 7.76, 95%CI: 5.94-10.13). The ECI was 0.1430 (p < 0.001), indicating a pro-rich concentration of obesity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There are pro-rich inequalities in obesity prevalence in Ghana. Wealthier women, particularly those in urban and coastal areas, older age groups, and those with higher parity, are disproportionately affected by obesity. Policies and interventions aimed at reducing economic inequalities in obesity should consider the unique challenges faced by wealthier populations, such as promoting healthier diets and physical activity, while also addressing the broader structural factors that contribute to obesogenic environments.",2025,[],[]
Beyond weight loss: digital therapeutic for behavioral change and psychological well-being for individuals with overweight and obesity in a primary healthcare setting-A randomized controlled pilot study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Mobile health (mHealth) through digital therapeutics (DTx) offer a promising approach to obesity management. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Lifeness DTx for obesity care and its effect on anthropometrics, reward-related eating behaviors and quality of life in individuals with overweight and obesity within a community-based healthcare setting.<h4>Methods</h4>A 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted. Adults (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and central obesity) were recruited from municipal Healthy Life Centers in Norway. The intervention group (IG) received standard care plus full DTx app with program functionality and digital follow-up, whereas the control group (CG) received standard care with limited app functions and no DTx program. Outcome variables were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks.<h4>Results</h4>No significant changes in body weight, or differences between groups were observed at W12. The IG showed reductions in waist circumference (-3.4 cm, <i>p</i> = 0.008, <i>d</i> = -0.926), waist-to-height ratio (-0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.008, <i>d</i> = -0.929), improvements on hedonic eating behavior, indicated by reduced disinhibition (-1.6, <i>p</i> = 0.013, <i>d</i> = -0.907), as well as increased quality of life (+5.0, <i>p</i> = 0.019, <i>d</i> = 0.899). Both groups increased self-esteem (IG +9.8, <i>p</i> = 0.018, <i>d</i> = 0.911, and CG +12, <i>p</i> = 0.050, <i>d</i> = 0.838).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The DTx intervention was associated with improvements in central adiposity, reward-related eating behaviors, and psychological well-being beyond weight loss. These findings provide preliminary evidence that digital therapeutics may represent a feasible and scalable approach to support personalized obesity care in primary healthcare settings. Larger, adequately powered trials are needed to confirm these results.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT06667843 (Initial Release: 10/15/2024).",2025,[],[]
Inhibiting miR-200a-3p Increases Sirtuin 1 and Mitigates Kidney Injury in a Tubular Cell Model of Diabetes and Hypertension-Related Renal Damage.,"Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are key contributors to kidney damage, with the renal tubule playing a central role in the progression of kidney disease. MicroRNAs have important regulatory roles in renal injury and are among the most abundant cargos within extracellular vesicles (EVs), emerging as novel kidney disease biomarkers and therapeutic tools. Previously, we identified miR-200a-3p and its target SIRT1 as having a potential role in kidney injury. We aimed to evaluate miR-200a-3p levels in EVs from patient's urine and delve into its function in causing tubular injury. We quantified miR-200a-3p urinary EV levels in hypertensive patients with and without diabetes (<i>n</i> = 69), 42 of which were with increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE). We analysed miR-200a-3p levels in EVs and cellular pellets, as well as their targets at mRNA and protein levels in renal tubule cells (RPTECs) subjected to high glucose and Angiotensin II treatments, and observed their influence on apoptosis, RPTEC markers and tubular injury markers. We conducted microRNA mimic and inhibitor transfections in treated RPTECs. Our findings revealed elevated miR-200a-3p levels in increased UAE patient urinary EVs, effectively discriminating UAE (AUC of 0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.003). In vitro, miR-200a-3p and renal injury markers increased, while RPTEC markers, SIRT1, and apoptosis decreased under treatments. Experiments using miR-200a-3p mimics and inhibitors revealed a significant impact on SIRT1 and decrease in tubular damage through miR-200a-3p inhibition. Increased levels of miR-200a-3p emerge as a potential disease marker, and its inhibition provides a therapeutic target aimed at reducing renal tubular damage linked to hypertension and diabetes.",2025,"['mir - 200a - 3p', 'sirt1', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'albumin', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'an', '##giotensin ii', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'sirt1', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'sirt1', 'mir - 200a - 3p', 'mir - 200a - 3p']","['sirt1', 'albumin']"
Immunopathogenic mechanisms and immunoregulatory therapies in MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of approximately 30%; however, effective pharmacotherapies are still limited due to its complex pathogenesis and etiology. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of disease pathogenesis is urgently needed. An increasing number of studies suggest that MASLD and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), are driven by chronic overnutrition, multiple genetic susceptibility factors, and pathogenic consequences, including hepatocyte damage and liver inflammation. Hepatic inflammation is the key event fueling the conversion from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Current therapies for MASH, including the recently approved thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist resmetirom or the available incretin mimetics, mainly target metabolic injury to the liver but not inflammation directly. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of current data related to the immunological mechanisms of MASLD and summarize the effects of current and experimental therapies on immunoregulation in MASLD.",2025,"['thyroid hormone receptor - beta', 'incre']",['thyroid hormone receptor beta']
Three-dimensional network of creatine metabolism: From intracellular energy shuttle to systemic metabolic regulatory switch.,"<h4>Background</h4>Creatine serves as an intracellular shuttle for high-energy phosphate bonds, enabling rapid ATP transfer from energy-producing to energy-consuming cellular compartments. In skeletal muscle, creatine coordinates energy distribution among mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and the phosphagen system. Consequently, creatine supplementation acutely enhances muscular performance and is widely utilized as an ergogenic aid in power-based sports. Recent studies demonstrate that enhanced creatine metabolism in adipose tissue promotes brown adipocyte renewal and boosts energy expenditure in cold environments or sedentary conditions, thereby improving overall systemic metabolism. Beyond its traditional role as an exercise supplement, the creatine metabolic network has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.<h4>Scope of review</h4>This review begins by revisiting the history and latest advancements in creatine research, and ultimately proposes three dimensions for the current explanation of creatine metabolism: (1) subcellular energy transport; (2) muscle-fat metabolic axis; (3) systemic energy sensing and metabolic reprogramming.<h4>Major conclusions</h4>The creatine cycle enables directed energy flow through mitochondrial supercomplexes (VDAC/ANT-CK) and resets systemic metabolism via subcellular energy tunnels and inter-organ interactions. Creatine kinase (CK) condensates, through liquid-liquid phase separation, can rapidly meet energy demands during exercise. Therefore, targeting the dynamics of the CK phase may be promising for enhancing athletic performance and improving metabolic diseases.",2025,"['vdac', 'ant - ck', 'creatine kinase', 'ck', 'ck']","['vdac', 'creatine kinase']"
Dietary lipid overload creates a suppressive environment that impedes the antiviral functions of NK cells.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells able to recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells. NK cell activity strongly correlates with a metabolic reprogramming and breakdown of fatty acids by β-oxidation during virus infections. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the impact of obesity on antiviral NK cell functions. Here, employing the Friend retrovirus mouse model, we show that the cytotoxicity and cytokine production of NK cells was impaired in obesity, leading to higher viral loads. NK cells suppression in obesity was mediated by activated Tregs. Furthermore, obese mice that were switched back to a regular diet showed complete recovery of the NK cell activity. Interestingly, feeding mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) for just ten days caused NK cell dysfunction and increased retroviral burden. This study is the first to link the detrimental impact of an obesity-induced immunosuppressive microenvironment with NK cell dysfunction during an acute retroviral infection.",2025,['tregs'],[]
Illuminating the Druggable Human Proteome with an AI Protein Profiling Platform,"Creating a ligandable atlas for the proteome would transform our understanding of protein functions and accelerate therapeutic discovery; however, proteomic approaches are constrained by insufficient proteome coverage and data heterogeneity, while existing machine learning (ML) models have limited oiwer due to structural dependencies and heterogeneous experimental labels. Here we developed AiPP, a multimodal AI platform that predicts and characterizes ligand interaction sites directly from protein sequence. AiPP is powered by the evolutionary-scale protein large language models (LLMs) and leverages two harmonized ML training sets derived from the new databases comprising cysteine ligandability from activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) studies and reversible binding evidenced from co-crystal structures. We developed a LLM representation based clustering framework to interrogate, reconcile, and augment experimental labels in both databases. Two complementary protocols were implemented to iteratively expand the training data while improving model performance. Although trained exclusively on ABPP data, AiPP recovers 80% (Top-1) of cysteine liganding events from co-crystal structures, with 84% AUPRC and 89% AUROC. AiPP recapitulates consistently and heterogeneously liganded cysteines across cancer cell lines and reliably identifies dynamic, ligandable pockets in “undruggable” transcription factors. Remarkably, AiPP accurately predicts active-site and allosteric cysteines in protein tyrosine phosphatases that were undetected by ABPP. Finally, we applied AiPP to the entire human proteome, identifying ligandable sites in proteins that were undetected or unliganded by ABPP, including an allosteric site in MC3R, which is a therapeutic target for treatment of eating disorder and obesity. This proteomewide covalent ligandability atlas (version 1.0) is anticipated to guide future development of chemical probes and pharmaceutical modulators, particularly for understudied proteins and currently undruggable targets. The LLM-based approach to interrogate large-scale heterogeneous data is broadly applicable to protein research and development of proteomics-derived ML models for diverse applications.",2025,"['protein tyrosine phosphatases', 'abpp', 'abpp', 'mc3r']","['protein tyrosine phosphatases', 'abpp', 'mc3r']"
"The health economics of insulin therapy: How do we address the rising demands, costs, inequalities and barriers to achieving optimal outcomes.","The health economic value of insulin is usually expressed within a cost-effectiveness framework providing an estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Insulin clinical trials adopt a treat-to-target design in which both intervention and control arms aim to achieve similar levels of glycaemic control thereby allowing a comparison of secondary safety outcomes such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain. While of use to inform clinicians about the new insulin's tolerability, it is of limited use for an economic evaluation. An insulin's true potential value requires an assessment of the relationship between the benefits of attaining individualised glycaemic goals versus the factors known to act as barriers to the initiation/intensification of insulin and that also contribute to poor adherence in clinical practice. Addressing the rising demands that diabetes will impose upon the healthcare system will require the simultaneous execution of multiple strategies that acknowledge population dynamics, healthcare delivery constraints, the role of innovation and funding requirements. Accounting for patient-specific characteristics to develop individualised plans and utilising technologies that address relevant barriers to care will require a whole-system perspective on healthcare value and an appreciation of the interconnectivity of stakeholder needs. Importantly, convenience and treatment satisfaction are often not considered valuable features of insulin therapy; not only do they have value, but they are essential to addressing rising demands. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: More people around the world are living with diabetes. This is because people are living longer, populations are getting older, and more people are developing the disease. Clinicians will have to prescribe insulin for more people. To make well-informed decisions about how to spend money on diabetes care, we need to understand how much therapies costs and how well they work. In healthcare, people often talk about ""value for money."" This means getting better results without spending more money, or saving money without making things worse. However, it's not always easy to figure out the value of new types of insulin. The way insulin is studied in clinical trials doesn't always relate well to how it works, and is used, in real-life clinical practice. Many studies don't look at all the things that matter, like how easy it is for people to use the insulin or how it affects their daily lives. When two types of insulin have comparable efficacy in terms of lowering blood sugar, other things - like side effects, how easy it is to use, and how well people stick to their treatment - become important drivers of value. These things are different for each person, may be left out of studies and may not considered to be important by decision makers. In this paper, we first discuss how the health economics of insulin has traditionally been studied, and look at the findings, advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. We also describe how tools like continuous glucose monitors (which track blood sugar all the time) can help people improve outcomes. We introduce what we call the ""insulin value system."" This looks at how the features of the insulin, the patient's circumstances, and the state of the healthcare system interact to determine the value of a new therapy. In the case of insulin therapies, traditional approaches to value assessment don't always capture the full picture. Our second goal is to talk about the big challenges in diabetes care, for which there are no easy solutions. More people are getting diabetes, and more money will be needed for treatment and disease management. We believe that to really help make a difference, we need to consider the whole healthcare system, how everything is connected, and not just focus on one part. We believe it's important to look at how people live and work, their personal circumstances and how they and the healthcare system interact when assessing the value of insulin. That way, we can better understand how new treatments can help both people and the wider healthcare system.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']

The Prevalence of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors on Diabetic Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Individuals on Antiretroviral Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>People with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWHIV) have a higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Previous studies have depicted that PLWHIV have these NCDs due to the predisposing risk factors of CVDs including dyslipidaemia, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, obesity, and elevated glycated hemoglobin. Understanding the cumulative consequences of these disorders is critical in this population. Hence, the aim of this protocol is to narrate the methods and techniques that will be used to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of various CVD risk factors among diabetic individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, this review will explore the extent to which traditional and HIV-specific risk factors contribute to the beginning and progression of CVD in the HIV-positive population by merging available data.<h4>Methods</h4>Literature search will be conducted using selected keywords on databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of science to identify eligible publications according to the eligibility criteria. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines will be used for reporting and risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I tool). Data synthesis and sensitivity analysis will be performed using RevMan software and strength of evidence will be assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach (GRADE) pro tool.<h4>Ethical considerations and registration</h4>This systematic review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024524396) and it doesn't require any ethical clearance as it will use data from published reports.",2025,['hemoglobin'],['hemoglobin']
Selective remodelling of the adipose niche in obesity and weight loss.,"Weight loss significantly improves metabolic and cardiovascular health in people with obesity<sup>1-3</sup>. The remodelling of adipose tissue (AT) is central to these varied and important clinical effects<sup>4</sup>. However, surprisingly little is known about the underlying mechanisms, presenting a barrier to treatment advances. Here we report a spatially resolved single-nucleus atlas (comprising 171,247 cells from 70 people) investigating the cell types, molecular events and regulatory factors that reshape human AT, and thus metabolic health, in obesity and therapeutic weight loss. We discover selective vulnerability to senescence in metabolic, precursor and vascular cells and reveal that senescence is potently reversed by weight loss. We define gene regulatory mechanisms and tissue signals that may drive a degenerative cycle of senescence, tissue injury and metabolic dysfunction. We find that weight loss reduces adipocyte hypertrophy and biomechanical constraint pathways, activating global metabolic flux and bioenergetic substrate cycles that may mediate systemic improvements in metabolic health. In the immune compartment, we demonstrate that weight loss represses obesity-induced macrophage infiltration but does not completely reverse activation, leaving these cells primed to trigger potential weight regain and worsen metabolic dysfunction.

Myo-Inositol Oxygenase (MIOX): A Pivotal Regulator and Therapeutic Target in Multiple Diseases.,"Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX), as the sole enzyme catalyzing myo-inositol (MI) catabolism in mammals, plays a central role in maintaining intracellular MI homeostasis. Dysregulation of MIOX activity disrupts MI metabolic balance, leading to pathological processes including oxidative stress, inflammation, and ferroptosis, which subsequently induce multiple diseases such as metabolic syndrome, neurological disorders, tumors, and reproductive/developmental disorders. This article systematically reviews the structure and function of MIOX as well as the pathological consequences arising from its dysregulation. Although its pathological significance is increasingly recognized, the molecular mechanisms of MIOX in many diseases have not been fully elucidated, and targeted modulators of MIOX are lacking. Future research should focus on the in-depth elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms of MIOX disorders and the development of MIOX modulators, thereby providing precise therapeutic strategies for related diseases.",2025,"['myo - inositol oxygenase', 'miox', 'miox', 'miox', 'miox', 'miox', 'miox', 'miox']","['myo inositol oxygenase', 'miox']"
Obesity in children and adolescents: Scoping exercise and prioritization for World Health Organization clinical guidelines.,"Current clinical guidance on children and adolescent obesity management is limited in scope and in addressing obesogenic factors, reaching underserved populations, and developing whole-of-society solutions. To address these shortcomings, the World Health Organization (WHO) set out to develop people-centered normative guidance for the integrated management of children and adolescents with obesity using a primary healthcare approach. WHO undertook a prioritization exercise consisting of (1) scoping of initial questions and outcomes, (2) public notice and comment, (3) guideline development group establishment and consultation, and (4) final approval. Initial questions and outcomes were compiled from core outcome sets and documents from WHO, United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and other UN agencies. Stakeholders and potential guideline development group members were identified from existing WHO resources and a call for experts. The public notice and comment involved assessment of initial questions and outcomes via a Delphi prioritization consensus survey, which received 349 full responses from 78 countries. Results were assessed and refined by the WHO obesity steering committee and two established guideline development groups: children and adolescents. The prioritization exercise resulted in eight background questions, 19 key questions for guideline development, 11 critical outcomes for decision-making, and 10 important but not critical outcomes for decision-making.",2025,[],[]
Severe Hypoalbuminaemia after Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass: A Diagnosis of Exclusion.,"Bariatric surgery has emerged as a highly effective treatment option for individuals with obesity. Severe hypoalbuminaemia is a feared complication after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. It is characterised by a low serum albumin level of <25 g/l, neither explained by renal losses, protein-losing enteropathy nor by liver disfunction, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Prompt workup leading to the diagnosis and aggressive treatment are recommended to prevent rapid clinical worsening; however, evidence-based recommendations and specific treatment approach are lacking. Most cases can be managed with dietary counselling and protein-enhanced oral supplements. We report a case of a female patient in her 50s with class II obesity, who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass eight months earlier, who presented to the Emergency Department with new onset of asthenia and lower limb oedema. Her biochemistry panel revealed severe serum hypoalbuminaemia, with a level of 18.4 g/l. After a thorough examination, complete laboratory tests and imaging that excluded renal and gastrointestinal losses and hepatic disfunction, she was presumed to have developed severe hypoalbuminemia after bariatric intervention. She managed to increase her oral intake of protein-enhanced products, according to nutritional counselling. At a six-month follow-up visit the patient regained 1% of the weight and had a slow and progressive increase in the serum albumin level. Our report highlights the importance of continuous nutritional monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach in the post-operative period of bariatric surgery to improve long-term outcomes.<h4>Learning points</h4>Severe hypoalbuminaemia caused by bariatric surgery requires exclusion of alternative aetiologies.Surgical reversal can often be avoided by appropriate dietary interventions.",2025,"['albumin', 'albumin']",['albumin']
&lt;i&gt;Setaria viridis&lt;/i&gt; Ethanol Extract Attenuates Muscle Loss and Body Fat Reduction in Sarcopenic Obesity by Regulating AMPK in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.,"Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by the concurrent presence of sarcopenia and obesity, presents a complex challenge due to the synergistic detrimental effects of muscle loss and excess body fat. This study investigated the potential of <i>Setaria viridis</i> (SV) supplementation for mitigating the impact of sarcopenic obesity on diet-induced obese mice. Mice in the study were divided into groups and fed a normal diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), or an HFD supplemented with 0.3% SV ethanol extract. After 16 weeks, SV supplementation significantly reduced body weight gain and white adipose tissue mass, improved plasma lipid profiles, and preserved liver function without affecting food intake. Additionally, SV enhanced skeletal muscle mass and hind-limb thickness, and restored anabolic signaling pathways such as IGF-1, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR. Notably, SV supplementation activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), accompanied by increased expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α, leading to improved mitochondrial function and reduced intramuscular fat deposition. Mechanistically, 3D molecular docking simulations revealed that luteolin 7-O-glucoside, a SV-derived flavonoid, binds to the AMPK ATP-binding site with high affinity, providing structural insight into SV's AMPK-activating potential. Furthermore, SV reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity (GSH, GR, GPx), thereby alleviating oxidative stress and tissue fibrosis. These findings suggest that SV supplementation counters obesity-induced muscle atrophy and metabolic dysfunction through flavonoid-mediated AMPK activation, supporting its potential as a safe and effective nutritional strategy for managing sarcopenic obesity.",2025,"['igf - 1', 'pi3k', 'a', '##kt', 'mtor', 'amp - activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'sirt1', 'pgc - 1α', 'ampk', 'ampk', 'tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'gsh', 'gr', 'gpx', 'ampk']","['pi3k', 'mtor', 'amp activated protein kinase', 'ampk', 'sirt1', 'gsh']"

Trends and future directions in childhood obesity research in the Nordic countries: a scientometric review.,"In the Nordic countries, about one in five children aged 5-18 years live with overweight or obesity. This scientometric review analyses the patterns of childhood obesity research in the Nordic region to inform future strategic decisions for researchers and policymakers. Using VOSviewer (version 1.6.20), we conducted a visualization analysis of Nordic childhood obesity literature from Scopus, covering publication up to February 2024. Additionally, R version 4.4.0, and Microsoft Excel 2016 were used to support further analysis. The analysis included trends of scientific outputs, citations, patterns, collaboration network, and leading institutions. In the Nordic countries, 4123 documents were published from 1981 to 2024. A consistent increase was identified in collaborative studies since 1981. Sweden is playing a leading role in childhood obesity research. A strong partnership was noted between Danish and Swedish researchers, as well as between Finnish and Swedish researchers, with Sweden being a central hub of collaboration. The highly cited publications primarily focused on non-pharmacological public health interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Significant advancement has been achieved in understanding childhood obesity primarily focused on the filed medicine and nursing. Overweight, obesity, and metrics like body mass index have been extensively investigated, but no focus has been placed on medication as treatment. Despite the increasing research in this field, knowledge gaps exist in genetics, molecular biology, emerging pharmacological treatment as well as behavioral and social sciences. Future research should utilize the unique Nordic databases and advanced methods to improve understanding and inform effective public health interventions.",2025,[],[]
Gut Microbiota-Targeted Therapeutics for Metabolic Disorders: Mechanistic Insights into the Synergy of Probiotic-Fermented Herbal Bioactives.,"Gut microbiota dysbiosis is intricately linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperlipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly when combined with probiotic fermentation, offers a promising therapeutic strategy by modulating microbial balance and host metabolism. This narrative review synthesizes current research on probiotic-fermented herbal bioactives, focusing on their mechanisms in ameliorating metabolic diseases. Probiotic and bioactive compounds (e.g., berberine, polysaccharides) are highlighted for their roles in enhancing intestinal barrier function, regulating microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and reducing inflammation. Fermentation techniques improve the bioavailability of TCM components while reducing toxicity, as seen in fermented <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> and <i>Rhizoma Coptidis</i>. Despite promising results, challenges include the complexity of microbiota-host interactions and variability in TCM standardization. Future directions emphasize integrating multi-omics technologies and personalized approaches to optimize probiotic-fermented TCM therapies. This review underscores the potential of combining traditional herbal wisdom with modern biotechnology to address metabolic disorders, which pose significant global health challenges, through a ""gut microbiota-metabolism"" axis. Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of these conditions. TCM has shown promise in modulating gut microbiota to restore metabolic homeostasis. This review synthesizes current research on TCM-derived interventions, such as herbal compounds, probiotics, and fermentation techniques, that target gut microbiota to ameliorate metabolic disorders. We discuss mechanisms of action, including prebiotic effects, enhancement of intestinal barrier function, and regulation of microbial metabolites, while addressing the limitations and future directions of TCM-based therapies.",2025,[],[]
Exploring the interplay between circadian rhythms and obesity: A Boolean network approach to understanding metabolic dysregulation.,"This study investigates the interaction between circadian rhythms and lipid metabolism disruptions in the context of obesity. Obesity is known to interfere with daily rhythmicity, a crucial process for maintaining brain homeostasis. To better understand this relationship, we analyzed transcriptional data from mice fed with normal or high-fat diet, focusing on the mechanisms linking genes involved with those regulating circadian rhythms. We performed biological enrichment analysis and Boolean network modeling to identify direct interactions between these genes. The resulting mathematical model provided a comprehensive system of gene interactions, primarily highlighting lipid metabolism. Our findings revealed key insights into the effects of obesity on circadian rhythm genes, particularly the under-expression of core genes such as Bmal1 and Clock. Crucially, we identified a reciprocal interaction between obesity and circadian genes, where disruptions on one exacerbated the dysfunction in the other. This mechanism suggests that the disruption of circadian rhythms plays a pivotal role in worsening the metabolic disturbances associated with obesity, providing new perspectives for targeting circadian pathways in obesity-related metabolic disorders.",2025,['bmal1'],['bmal1']

Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase in Cardiovascular Diseases: Metabolic Regulator and Emerging Therapeutic Target.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, arising from complex interactions among metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) has recently emerged as a key metabolic regulator in CVD pathogenesis. By consuming nicotinamide and methyl groups, NNMT perturbs epigenetic, metabolic, and redox pathways that are critical for cardiovascular health. NNMT-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion impairs mitochondrial function, sirtuin (SIRT) activity, redox balance, and energy metabolism, thereby creating a pro-atherogenic environment. NNMT and its product 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) show a complex duality: they modulate SIRT activity-particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3-to influence gluconeogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and mitochondrial antioxidant defenses. NNMT upregulation also elevates homocysteine levels, activating pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative cascades (e.g., TLR4-NF-κB and STAT3-IL-1β). Growing evidence links NNMT to major CVD risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Thus, NNMT has a multifaceted role in cardiovascular health: while its enzymatic activity is often pathogenic (via NAD<sup>+</sup>/SAM consumption and homocysteine production), its metabolite 1-MNA can exert protective effects (via NRF2 activation and anti-thrombotic mechanisms). This duality highlights the need to delineate the molecular processes that balance these opposing actions. Experimental studies using small-molecule NNMT inhibitors and RNA interference have shown promising cardiometabolic benefits in preclinical models, including improved insulin sensitivity, reduced atherosclerosis, and attenuated cardiac dysfunction. However, no clinical trials have yet targeted NNMT specifically in CVD. Future research should clarify the tissue-specific functions of NNMT and translate these insights into novel therapeutic strategies.",2025,"['nicotinamide n - methyltransferase', 'nnmt', 'nnmt', 'nnmt', 'sirtuin', 'sirt', 'nnmt', 'sirt', 'sirt1', 'sirt3', 'nnmt', 'tlr4', 'nf - κb', 'stat3', 'il - 1β', 'nnmt', 'nnmt', 'nrf2', 'nnmt', 'insulin', 'nnmt', 'nnmt']","['nicotinamide n methyltransferase', 'nnmt', 'sirtuin', 'sirt', 'sirt1', 'sirt3', 'tlr4', 'stat3', 'nrf2', 'insulin']"
Emerging implications of N6-methyladenosine in prostate cancer progression and treatment.,"RNA modifications are widely distributed in almost all types of RNA, including mRNA, rRNA, miRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA, which are deeply involved in disease initiation and progression and are emerging therapeutic targets in diseases such as cancer, among which N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification. Accumulating studies have demonstrated the critical role of m6A during cancer progression and its therapeutic potential in prostate cancer, which is one of the most common malignancies in men worldwide. Here, we reviewed the emerging roles of m6A regulators, including readers, writers, and erasers, and the downstream m6A-modified mRNA and noncoding RNA in prostate cancer. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A in prostate cancer and summarized the emerging agents and technologies, such as the cutting-edge CRISPR-Cas13 in prostate cancer treatment by targeting m6A regulatory pathways. At last, we elucidated the perspective of developing efficient and specific RNA targeting agents and technological platforms to provide new strategies for treating prostate cancer by targeting RNA modifications.",2025,"['m6a', 'm6a', 'm6a', 'm6a', 'm6a']",['m6a']
A call for doubling the diagnostic rate of at-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is an increasingly important contributor to morbidity and mortality.

The prevalence of MASH is higher among people living with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes, with MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis affecting one in six adults. Delivering a paradigm shift in MASH diagnosis in the four countries studied will require an expansion of community-based diagnostic capability that will also foster prevention efforts and provide opportunities for treatment and care.",2025,"['mash', 'mash', 'mash']",['mash']
Childhood obesity and insulin resistance is correlated with gut microbiome serum protein: an integrated metagenomic and proteomic analysis.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the gut microbiota and proteins related to metabolism and immunity caused by childhood obesity and insulin resistance (IR) and to assess the underlying relationship between the gut microbiota and IR in children. Nineteen children with obesity and sixteen healthy children were recruited. Children with obesity were divided into two groups: obese with IR and obese without IR. All of the obese children participated in a 1-month lifestyle-based weight loss program. Faecal metagenomics and serum Olink proteomics combined with clinical parameters were used to identify the metabolic alterations associated with childhood obesity and IR. The gut microbiota and serum protein were significantly altered in obese children with IR. The relative abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila, IGFBP1 and GP6 were decreased in obese children with IR. Butyricicoccus sp. AM29-23AC, DLK1, CD163, CCL16 and CTSD levels were recovered after IR improved. TNFR1 had a significant indirect effect on the interaction between s-Citrobacter.freundii and fasting insulin. In conclusion, obese children with IR have abnormal gut microbiota and serum proteins related to metabolism and immunity, which can be improved after weight loss. The gut microbiome of children with obesity may contribute to the development of IR by triggering metabolic inflammation.Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Registration number: ChiCTR2300072179).",2025,"['insulin', 'igfbp1', 'gp6', 'dlk1', 'c', '##d163', 'ccl16', 'ctsd', 'tnfr1', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'igfbp1', 'gp6', 'dlk1', 'ccl16', 'ctsd', 'tnfr1']"
TGF-β1-dependent expression of FOXS1 attenuates adipogenic potential and enhances a myofibroblast cellular phenotype.,"White adipose tissue (WAT) fibrosis is a major determinant of obesity-induced cardiometabolic dysfunction and is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and myofibroblast activation. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a profibrotic cytokine that potently induces myofibroblast activation in adipocyte stem cells (ASCs). How TGF-β1 orchestrates ASC activation in WAT fibrosis is not completely understood. We identified FOXS1, a member of the forkhead box transcription factor superfamily, as a transcriptional target of TGF-β1 signaling in primary human WAT ASC (hASC). FOXS1 potentiated TGF-β1-dependent upregulation of several myofibroblast genes (e.g. Acta2, Col1a1, Fn1, and Il11) in 10T1/2 fibroblasts. FOXS1 also attenuated the induction of several adipogenic factors (e.g. Pparg, Stat5a, Fabp4, and Adipoq) in 10T1/2 fibroblasts and sensitized these cells to the antiadipogenic effects of TGF-β1. Furthermore, loss of endogenous FOXS1 improved adipogenic permissiveness and activated proadipogenic gene programs in 10T1/2 cells, even after TGF-β1 stimulation. These results indicate that FOXS1 is a positive regulator of profibrotic TGF-β1-dependent cellular responses, orchestrating the regulation of molecular phenotypes that promote myofibroblast activation and block adipogenesis. These findings offer novel insight into the TGF-β1-dependent roles of FOXS1 in fibroblasts within the context of profibrotic ASC activation and provide a foundation for further investigation into the role of FOXS1 in WAT fibrosis and obesity-induced cardiometabolic dysfunction.",2025,"['transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - β1', 'tgf - β1', 'foxs1', 'forkhead box transcription factor superfamily', 'tgf - β1', 'foxs1', 'tgf - β1', 'acta2', 'col1a1', 'fn1', 'il11', 'foxs1', 'pparg', 'stat5a', 'fabp4', 'adipoq', 'tgf - β1', 'foxs1', 'tgf - β1', 'foxs1', 'tgf - β1', 'tgf - β1', 'foxs1', 'foxs1']","['foxs1', 'acta2', 'col1a1', 'fn1', 'il11', 'pparg', 'stat5a', 'fabp4', 'adipoq']"
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Antibiotics in Children: Perspectives on Model-Informed Precision Dosing.,"The appropriate use of antibiotics is crucial and involves selecting an optimal dosing regimen based on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) indicators. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a powerful tool that integrates drugs' physicochemical properties with anatomical and physiological data to predict PK behavior. In pediatric populations, PBPK modeling accounts for developmental changes in organ function, making it particularly useful for optimizing antibiotic dosing across different age groups, from neonates to adolescents. In recent decades, PBPK modeling has been widely applied to predict antibiotic disposition in pediatric patients for various clinical and research purposes. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is an evolving approach that enhances traditional therapeutic drug monitoring by integrating multiple information sources into a mathematical framework. By incorporating PBPK modeling, MIPD could offer a more optimized antibiotic dosing that accounts for PK/PD parameters at the site of infection, improving therapeutic outcomes while minimizing toxicity. This review summarizes currently published pediatric PBPK modeling studies on antibiotics, covering various objectives such as evaluating drug-drug interactions, PK/PD analyses in targeted tissues, predicting PK in specific populations (e.g., maternal/fetal, renal impairment, obesity), and PK predictions for preterm neonates. Based on these reports, the review discusses the implications of PBPK modeling for MIPD in pediatric antibiotic therapy.",2025,[],[]

Advancing prostate cancer research: an exploration of periprostatic adipose stem cells.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men, highlighting the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. The periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) plays a crucial role in the PCa tumor microenvironment, with direct crosstalk between PPAT and PCa cells, particularly in advanced stages with extraprostatic extension-a feature linked to poor prognosis. Owing to their migratory capacity, adipose stem cells (ASCs) are promising in regenerative medicine and play a key role in tissue engineering and cancer research. These findings offer potential for novel approaches in targeted drug delivery and gene therapy for PCa. While ASCs within PPAT influence the tumor stroma, the mechanisms behind their interactions with PCa cells are not fully understood, with studies reporting both inhibitory and promoting effects on cancer progression. The adipose tissue secretome, including PPAT-ASC exosomal proteins, mediates communication between PPAT and PCa cells, with exosomal dysregulation observed in stage T3 PCa. This dysregulation implicates key cancer pathways such as integrin-mediated cell interactions, epithelialmesenchymal transition, and mRNA stability regulation. Although ASCs show promise as therapeutic carriers, their use is complicated by the need to prevent unwanted interactions with cancer cells. Moreover, environmental contaminants such as endocrine disruptors can alter ASC behavior, potentially influencing PCa development. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the multifaceted roles of ASCs and ASC-derived exosomes in PCa biology, their therapeutic applications, and the impact of environmental toxicants on their function and cancer-related outcomes. Further research into the underlying biological mechanisms is needed, highlighting the need for safe, targeted therapeutic approaches in PCa treatment.",2025,"['pp', 'as', 'in', '##tegrin']",[]
Body Weight Loss Experience Among Adults from Saudi Arabia and Assessment of Factors Associated with Weight Regain: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Weight loss and its subsequent regain pose significant challenges for those dealing with overweight and obesity. This study explores weight loss strategies among adults in Saudi Arabia and evaluates factors linked to weight regain. <b>Methods</b>: This cross-sectional study focused on adults residing in Jazan, located in southwest Saudi Arabia. Data collection was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire that assessed participants' demographics, medical history, perceptions of body weight, weight loss methods, and the incidence of weight regain. Logistic regression was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences related to the occurrence of weight regain. <b>Results</b>: A total of 368 participants reported efforts to lose weight over the past 3 years. The average age of these participants was 32.7 years (standard deviation: 11.3), and the gender distribution was almost equal. The majority of the sample (65%) voiced dissatisfaction with their body weight. Some participants employed a combination of weight loss methods, with exercise, reduced food intake, and intermittent fasting being the most frequently mentioned. The findings also indicate that a minority sought professional help, whether from a physician or a nutritionist. Over 90% claimed to have successfully lost weight at least once during their attempts, but more than half (139 individuals) experienced weight regain following their weight loss efforts. Within the univariate logistic regression, higher odds ratios of weight regain were detected among men, older participants, those living in rural areas, individuals with higher levels of education, employed persons or business owners, those with higher monthly incomes, smokers, khat chewers, and those diagnosed with a chronic condition (<i>p</i> values < 0.05). However, the multivariate logistic regression revealed that only residence, monthly income, smoking status, and being diagnosed with a chronic disease remained statistically significant as predictors of weight regain after adjusting for other variables (<i>p</i> values < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings highlight the significance of incorporating weight regain prevention into body weight management for individuals dealing with overweight and obesity. Further research is needed to evaluate specific dietary, physical activity, and psychological factors that may increase the risk of weight regain in certain participants.",2025,[],[]
Myosin VI and β-arrestin synergistically regulate GIPR internalization and signaling,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (GIPR) stimulates insulin release and regulates metabolic homeostasis. GIPR function is shaped by spatiotemporal trafficking of this G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). While GPCR endocytosis is traditionally associated with β-arrestin, GIPR internalization is only modestly dependent on this pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that GIPR engages a cytoskeletal motor, myosin VI to drive receptor endocytosis. GIPR engages the adaptor-motor complex through a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) at its C-ail. Interestingly, β-arrestin binding to phosphorylated residues upstream of the PBM enhance myosin VI recruitment and activation. GIPR internalization is dependent on both receptor phosphorylation and the PBM site to recruit β-arrestin and myosin VI, respectively. Synergistic engagement of β-arrestin and myosin VI results in desensitization of GIP-stimulated cAMP signaling while activating pERK1/2 from endosomal compartments. Blocking myosin VI activity enhances insulin release in pancreatic beta cells, demonstrating a novel role for this pathway in regulating the physiological effects of GIPR. Our findings highlight the direct convergence of two independent trafficking pathways at the level of the receptor C-tail, with implications for the nuanced regulation of individual GPCRs through the differential engagement of β-arrestin and myosin VI. <h4>Significance</h4>  GIPR has emerged as a frontline drug target in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Cellular effects of GIPR are regulated by receptor internalization and desensitization through mechanisms that are unclear. Here, we identify a novel GIPR trafficking pathway through the engagement of a cytoskeletal motor, myosin VI. Myosin VI and β-arrestin synergistically regulate GIPR endocytosis, signaling and insulin response in pancreatic beta cells. Our study highlights the convergence of two parallel trafficking mechanisms in GPCR function with potential implications in targeting metabolic disorders.",2025,"['glucose - dependent', 'insulinotropic peptide receptor', 'gipr', 'insulin', 'gipr', 'g protein - coupled receptor', 'gpcr', 'gpcr', 'β - arrestin', 'gipr', 'gipr', 'myosin vi', 'gipr', 'pdz - binding motif', 'β - arrestin', 'myosin vi', 'gipr', 'β - arrestin', 'myosin vi', 'β - arrestin', 'myosin vi', 'perk1 / 2', 'myosin vi', 'insulin', 'gipr', 'gpcrs', 'β - arrestin', 'myosin vi', 'gipr', 'gipr', 'gipr', 'myosin vi', 'myosin vi', 'β - arrestin', 'gipr', 'insulin', 'gpcr']","['gipr', 'insulin', 'g protein coupled receptor', 'gpcr', 'myosin vi']"
Veggies4myHeart digital game: an educational tool to promote vegetable consumption in preschool children - a multicentre experimental study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Vegetable consumption as part of a balanced and diversified dietary pattern is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Even though the scientific evidence for these benefits is strong, the consumption of vegetables remains far below recommendations, especially in early childhood. Despite existing literature, the evidence on how to increase vegetable consumption in preschool children remains limited and the development and validation of new strategies should be pursued in varied contexts. The study presented herein aimed to compare the impact of educational sessions based on the serious game Veggies4myHeart and repeated exposure to vegetables on preschool children's willingness to taste them and also their nutrition knowledge, measured at baseline and post-intervention, in Portuguese and Swiss preschool children.<h4>Methods</h4>The intervention was carried out in preschools with 39 Portuguese and 45 Swiss children, from 3 to 6 years old, in their preschools, between May 2019 and February 2021. Children participated in weekly 20-minute educational sessions for 5 weeks, delivered by trained nutritionists and incorporating the Veggies4myHeart digital game. Willingness to taste was assessed by offering the five raw vegetables in standard portions and recording whether each child tasted them at baseline, throughout the intervention, and post-intervention. Nutrition knowledge was assessed using three questionnaires applied before and after the intervention. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS software and statistical significance was set at p-value < 0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Comparing the results between the two countries post-intervention, statistically significant differences were found in the willingness to taste lettuce, carrot, and red cabbage, with Portuguese children showing more willingness to taste these vegetables than Swiss children (p < 0,05). Improvements in nutrition knowledge, from baseline to post-intervention, were observed in both countries (p < 0,001), but without statistically significant differences between countries (p = 0.114).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite differences in context and eating habits of Portuguese and Swiss children, the intervention with the Veggies4myHeart digital game increased preschoolers' willingness to taste vegetables, supporting the value of repeated exposure combined with digital tools. Improvement in nutrition knowledge further reinforces the potential of serious games as comprehensive educational strategies for promoting healthy habits in young children.",2025,[],[]
"Leveraging free-text diagnoses to identify patients with diabetes mellitus, obesity or dyslipidaemia - a cross-sectional study in a large Swiss primary care database.","<h4>Background</h4>Electronic medical records (EMRs) in general practice provide various methods for identifying patients with specific diagnoses. While several studies have focused on case identification via structured EMR components, diagnoses in general practice are frequently documented as unstructured free-text entries, making their use for research challenging. Furthermore, diagnoses may remain undocumented even when evidence of the underlying disease exists within structured EMR data.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to quantify the extent to which free-text diagnoses contribute to identifying additional cases of diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidaemia (target diseases) and assess the cases missed when relying exclusively on free-text entries.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study utilised EMR data from all consultations up to 2019 for 6,000 patients across 10 general practices in Switzerland. Diagnoses documented in a free-text entry field for diagnoses were manually coded for target diseases. Cases were defined as patients with a corresponding coded free-text diagnosis or meeting predefined criteria in structured EMR components (medication data or clinical and laboratory parameters). For each target disease, prevalence was calculated along with the proportion of cases identified exclusively via free-text diagnoses and the proportion missed when using free-text diagnoses alone.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence estimates for diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidaemia were 8.8%, 16.2% and 38.9%, respectively. Few cases relied exclusively on free-text diagnoses for identification, but a substantial proportion of cases were missed when relying solely on free-text diagnoses, particularly for obesity (19.5% exclusively identified; 50.7% missed) and dyslipidaemia (8.7% exclusively identified; 53.3% missed).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Free-text diagnoses were of limited utility for case identification of diabetes mellitus, obesity or dyslipidaemia, suggesting that manual coding of free-text diagnoses may not always be justified. Relying solely on free-text diagnoses for case identification is not recommended, as substantial proportions of cases may remain undetected, leading to biased prevalence estimates.",2025,[],[]
Metabolic Reprogramming Through Polyphenol Networks: A Systems Approach to Metabolic Inflammation and Insulin Resistance,"Obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represent complex systemic disorders marked by chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, mito-chondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These pathophysiologi-cal processes disrupt insulin signaling and β-cell function, leading to impaired glucose homeostasis across multiple organs. Conventional therapies often target isolated pathways, overlooking the intricate molecular crosstalk and organelle-level disturb-ances driving disease progression. Citrus-derived polyphenols—including hesperidin, naringenin, nobiletin, and tange-retin have emerged as promising agents capable of orchestrating a multi-targeted “metabolic reprogramming.” These compounds modulate key signaling pathways, in-cluding AMPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and Nrf2, thereby enhancing insulin sensitivity, re-ducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and restoring redox balance. Further-more, they improve mitochondrial biogenesis, stabilize membrane potential, and alle-viate ER stress by modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), thus supporting cellular energy homeostasis and protein folding capacity. Evidence from preclinical studies and select clinical trials suggests that citrus poly-phenols can significantly improve glycemic control, reduce oxidative and inflamma-tory markers, and preserve β-cell function. Their pleiotropic actions across molecular and organ-level targets position them as integrative metabolic modulators.

Their pathophysiological intersection-commonly referred to as ""diabesity""-is sustained by a complex interplay of mechanisms, including visceral adipose tissue inflammation, macrophage polarization, disrupted insulin signaling, and adipokine imbalance. These processes contribute to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, impair pancreatic β-cell function, and exacerbate glucose intolerance. This review critically explores the mechanistic connections between obesity and T2DM, with a focus on recent advances in pharmacological therapies-such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists-alongside evidence-based lifestyle modifications and bariatric procedures. By integrating current translational and clinical findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective to support the development of more effective and individualized treatment strategies for diabesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'g', '##lp - 1 receptor', 's', '##glt2', 'gip', 'glp - 1 receptor']","['insulin', 'gip', 'glp 1 receptor']"
A Multidisciplinary Approach to Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: From Diagnosis to Long-Term Management-A Narrative Review.,"Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS), also known as Pickwickian syndrome, is a complex disorder characterized by obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), daytime hypercapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 45 mmHg), and sleep-disordered breathing, primarily affecting individuals with severe obesity. Its diagnosis requires the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation and involves comprehensive assessments, including clinical history, physical examination, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases, and sleep studies. The pathophysiology of OHS involves mechanical constraints from excessive adipose tissue, diminished central respiratory drive often linked to leptin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, all contributing to impaired ventilation and systemic inflammation. The condition often coexists with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), exacerbating nocturnal hypoxia and hypercapnia, which can lead to severe cardiopulmonary complications such as pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Epidemiologically, the rising global prevalence of obesity correlates with an increased incidence of OHS, yet underdiagnosis remains a significant challenge, often resulting in critical presentations like acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Management primarily centers on non-invasive ventilation modalities like CPAP and BiPAP, with an emphasis on individualized treatment plans, continuous monitoring, and addressing comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. Pharmacological interventions are still evolving, focusing on supportive care and metabolic regulation. Long-term adherence, psychological factors, and complications like ventilator failure or device intolerance highlight the need for ongoing multidisciplinary management. Overall, advancing our understanding of OHS's multifactorial mechanisms and optimizing tailored therapeutic strategies are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality associated with this increasingly prevalent syndrome.",2025,['leptin'],['leptin']

Advanced Proteomics Approaches Hold Potential for the Risk Assessment of Metabolism-Disrupting Chemicals as Omics-Based NAM: A Case Study Using the Phthalate Substitute DINCH.,"The concept of metabolic disruption through exposure to chemicals has expanded our understanding of how environmental pollution can contribute to metabolic dysregulation and, ultimately, diseases like obesity. New strategies for assessing the risks posed by chemicals are needed, and omics technologies, including proteomics, have proven to be powerful tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms of these metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs). A potential MDC is the plasticizer DINCH─an alternative to legacy phthalates like DEHP, whose primary metabolite MINCH has been linked to the induction of adipogenesis and lipid accumulation. Here, global proteomics was complemented with insights into protein thermal stability and the profiles of post-translational modification (PTM) acetylation and phosphorylation to provide a profound understanding of chemical-induced metabolic disruption in adipocytes. We demonstrate the utility of advanced proteomics approaches in assessing the effects of potential MDCs by using the human SGBS adipocyte cell line. Adipose tissue PTM data from dietary DINCH-exposed mice were assessed as an <i>in vivo</i> model, and <i>in vitro</i> data shed light on DINCH's molecular effects, including protein interactions beyond its primary target PPARγ. The results emphasize the potential of omics approaches to enhance current risk assessment frameworks for emerging contaminants.",2025,['pparγ'],['pparγ']

C-Phycocyanin Extract Modulates Thermogenic and Inflammatory Markers in Brown Adipose Tissue of High-Fat Diet-Fed Animals.,"C-phycocyanin (CPC), a bioactive compound derived from Spirulina, has been described as a molecule with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It has also been demonstrated that sustainably obtained CPC effectively inhibited body mass gain, regulated serum leptin and resistin levels, and prevented the onset of a pro-inflammatory state in Swiss mice fed a hyperlipidic diet. These results highlighted the anti-obesogenic potential of CPC. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been identified as a promising target in the treatment of obesity, playing a role in energy expenditure. In this study, Swiss mice fed a high-fat diet were supplemented with 500 mg/kg body weight of CPC daily for 12 and 16 weeks. BAT was collected, and Western blot and ELISA were performed. A reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as a decrease in leptin levels was observed in the tissue, which was also associated with a reduction in BAT relative weight to body mass. Furthermore, CPC administration was able to modulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels, which is crucial in the thermogenesis process. Therefore, this study demonstrated that supplementation with CPC reduces inflammatory cytokines associated with detrimental effects in the BAT, emerging as a tool in combating obesity and improving BAT function.",2025,"['leptin', 'resistin', 'leptin', 'c', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']","['leptin', 'resistin', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1']"
Role of Microneedles for Improved Treatment of Obesity: Progress and Challenges.,"Obesity is a global metabolic health epidemic characterized by excessive lipid and fat accumulation, leading to severe conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Immediate attention and management of obesity-related health risks are most warranted. The imbalance between fat absorption, metabolic rate, and environmental and genetic factors is responsible for obesity. Treatment typically involves lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. While lifestyle changes are crucial, effective treatment often necessitates medication as a preferred adjunct strategy. However, medications commonly used, such as oral pharmacotherapy, often show side effects due to systemic exposure and, thus, may not effectively target the intended areas, leading to drug loss. On the other hand, transdermal administration of drugs with microneedle (MN)-based technologies, a painless drug delivery approach with patient compliance, is gaining interest as an alternative obesity treatment, as it directly targets adipose tissue via local delivery, minimizing system exposure and dose reduction. This Review addresses the pathophysiology of obesity, current treatment strategies, challenges in the treatment of obesity using conventional formulations, the importance of the use of nano-based medications through transdermal delivery, and the use of MNs as a promising platform for the effective delivery of nanoparticle-based anti-obesity medications. The potential of combining MNs with stimuli-responsive and non-responsive adjuvant therapies to enhance treatment efficacy and patient outcomes is explored. In addition, the limitations and future perspectives related to the use of MNs for obesity are addressed to highlight the transformative potential of this technology for obesity management. MNs hold promise in precisely delivering anti-obesity drugs while requiring lower dosages and minimizing side effects compared to conventional oral or injectable therapies and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals struggling with obesity and its associated comorbidities.",2025,[],[]
miR-10b-5p regulates adipocyte lineage commitment and adipogenesis via targeting of Gata6 and Tubby,"<title>Abstract</title>  <p>2.1 Background Adipogenesis is a highly organised series of events that facilitates the healthy expansion of adipose tissue, beginning during embryogenesis and continuing throughout life. White adipogenesis protects against lipotoxicity, influencing insulin resistance and obesity-related comorbidities. Brown adipogenesis enhances energy expenditure, thereby counteracting weight gain, lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Recently, there has been a significant increase in interest regarding adipocyte differentiation, mainly focusing on the interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the transcriptional cascade that governs adipogenesis and metabolic dysfunction. This study aimed to identify miRNAs regulating white and brown adipocyte differentiation and define miRNA action in a stem cell model of adipogenesis. 2.2 Methods Small RNAseq analysis of primary mouse brown and white adipocytes (WAs) identified miR-10b to be upregulated in mature brown adipocytes (BAs). We generated two model systems: 1) immortalized brown pre-adipocytes treated with miRNA inhibitors and 2) CRISPR/Cas9 KO of miR-10b in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Both cell models were differentiated into mature adipocytes. To unravel the pathways that are affected by miR-10b depletion, a transcriptomic analysis was performed at key time points. 2.3 Results Both cell models showed that miR-10b-5p depletion severely impaired differentiation into mature adipocytes, as indicated by a lack of lipid droplet formation and reduced adipogenic gene expression. Gene expression analysis supports that miR-10b-5p directs embryonic stem (ES) cells towards the mesoderm lineage, promoting commitment to pre-adipocytes by downregulating Gata6 and its downstream target Bmp2. This mechanism appears to be unaffected in BAs. Our study demonstrated that miR-10b-5p regulates the later stages of adipogenesis, at least in part, by downregulating Tub, a direct target of miR-10b-5p. We also confirmed that miR-10b-5p alleviated the halted differentiation phenotypes of adipocytes by supressing the G Protein Signalling pathway mediated by Tubby. 2.4 Conclusions These results evidence that miR-10b inhibition plays a dynamic role in adipocyte biology, as its inhibitory effects manifest differently during the stem cell preadipocyte proliferation state and during the maturation phase of adipocytes. Collectively, our study demonstrated that miR-10b-5p may represent a new potential therapeutic target for lipodystrophy and obesity.</p>",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'mir - 10b', 'crispr', 'cas', 'mir - 10b', 'mir - 10b', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'gata6', 'bmp2', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'tub', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'mir - 10b - 5p', 'g protein', 'tubby. 2. 4', 'mir - 10b', 'mir - 10b - 5p']","['insulin', 'crispr', 'cas', 'gata6', 'bmp2', 'tub', 'g protein']"

Preferences and willingness to pay for early childhood healthy lifestyle initiative outcomes: A discrete choice experiment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Understanding stakeholder preferences and values for early childhood initiatives to support healthy diets, physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour is key for effective intervention design and resource allocation. This study aims to estimate the preferences for and value of outcomes from the perspectives of parents/caregivers of Australian children aged from birth to 5 years.<h4>Methods</h4>Discrete choice experiment, 466 parent/caregivers recruited from online platform. Participants selected between two healthy lifestyle initiatives or a ""neither"" option. Initiatives were described by attributes including cost, participation and outcomes. Mixed multinomial logistic models were used to determine preferences and willingness-to-pay per annum framed as an increase in income taxes.<h4>Results</h4>Effect on diet was the most important influence on parent/caregiver choice to participate (p < 0.01), followed by effect on physical activity (p < 0.01), wellbeing (p < 0.01) and healthy growth (p < 0.01). Parents/caregivers were less sensitive to cost for initiatives aimed at specific children (e.g., targeted initiatives for a priority population). Willingness-to-pay estimates ranged from AUD$176 for improved wellbeing to $219 for healthier diets.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Results suggest that leveraging the potential for healthier diets, followed by healthier physical activity behaviours, as a key benefit of participation may be particularly attractive to parents/caregivers. In addition, some level of equity preference could be acceptable to parents/caregivers in the allocation of scarce resources.",2025,[],[]

Scoping review of interventions aimed at promoting healthy screen use among adolescents.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of this scoping review is to map and synthesise existing literature on interventions aimed at promoting healthy screen use among adolescents. This review identifies the types, functions and settings of interventions, explores the diversity of targeted outcomes and highlights equity considerations and research gaps.<h4>Design</h4>We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the Arksey and O'Malley framework and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines.<h4>Data sources</h4>We systematically searched Medline, PsycINFO and ERIC from January 2013 to June 2024. Reference lists of included studies were also manually screened.<h4>Eligibility criteria</h4>We included peer-reviewed experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and qualitative studies reporting on interventions designed to promote healthy screen use among adolescents aged 10-19 years.<h4>Data extraction and synthesis</h4>One author extracted data using a structured charting form, and a second author verified all entries. Results were synthesised descriptively across key themes including target populations, theoretical frameworks, intervention components and reported outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>From 6433 records, we identified 93 articles on 81 interventions, mainly conducted in high school settings in the USA and Australia. Most examined short-term interventions targeting recreational screen time. Outcomes included media literacy, cyberbullying, internet and gaming addiction, safe internet use, social media use and mental and sexual health. Seventy-eight per cent of interventions attempted to educate adolescents, while 34% offered training activities (eg, educational sessions to elevate risk awareness and skill-based training to enhance digital literacy and self-regulation). Interventions targeting external influences were used less frequently. About 20% of studies showed no statistically significant findings, highlighting the need to promote evidence-based interventions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This review identifies a need for broader, multilevel strategies that account for contextual factors and social determinants in influencing screen use and its related health issues. Future research should explore long-term effectiveness while examining the potential moderating and mediating effects of social determinants. Equity considerations were not a primary focus of most interventions, underscoring an important gap in this literature. Future interventions could incorporate equity-focused design and evaluation to ensure they respond to the needs of diverse adolescent populations.",2025,[],[]
Obesity alters VLDL profile and remnant cholesterol differently in metabolically healthy men and women: a ¹H-NMR study.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>Lipoprotein particle (p) size and count beyond lipoprotein lipid content [triglycerides (tg) and cholesterol (c)] are critical for their atherogenicity. This study characterized lipoprotein profiles in metabolically healthy individuals with overweight or obesity and assessed the impact of sex, obesity, and lipid background.<h4>Methods</h4>Proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) was used to assess the composition of very low-, low-, intermediate-, and high-density lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL), and particle number and size of VLDL, LDL, and HDL in 101 healthy subjects with overweight and obesity.<h4>Results</h4>Men showed significantly higher VLDLc and VLDLtg levels, counts of VLDLp (all subfractions) and LDLp (total and small), and smaller LDLp size, compared to women. Men had lower HDLc and HDLp (total and medium). In Obesity (Ob) compared to overweight (Ov), VLDLp number, VLDLtg and remnant cholesterol (RC) levels were significantly increased [Fold changes (FC) Ob.vs.Ov: 1.45, 1.39, and 1.26, respectively]. When stratified by sex, obesity-related VLDL and IDL profile deterioration was evident only in women. Individuals with LDLc ≥ 130 mg/dL showed increased RC compared to those with LDLc < 130 mg/dL (FC:1.26). The median 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk REGICOR was low (2%), but higher in men and in obesity. Individuals with higher CVD risk showed increased VLDLc, VLDLtg, VLDLp, and RC levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Men had a higher 10-year CVD risk and a less favorable triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and RC profile, while obesity aggravated these patterns, particularly in women. These findings support considering high-risk lipoprotein patterns in targeted CVD prevention for overweight and obese populations.",2025,"['h', 't', 'very low -, low -, intermediate -, and high - density lipoproteins', 'vldl', 'ldl', 'idl', 'hdl', 'vldl', 'ldl', 'hdl', 'vldlc', 'vldltg', 'vldlp', 'ldlp', 'ldlp', 'hdlc', 'hdlp', 'vldlp', 'vldltg', 'vld', 'id', 'ldl', 'ldl', 'v', '##ldlc', 'vldltg', 'vldlp', 'h']","['vldl', 'ldl', 'idl', 'hdl', 'vldlc', 'ldlp', 'hdlc']"
Effects of resistance training and aerobic training on improving the composition of middle-aged adults with obesity in an interventional study.,"This study investigated the effectiveness of a resistance and aerobic training model among 71 middle-aged participants aged 30-60 (mean age 44.27 ± 8.67 years; mean BMI 27.94 ± 3.92 kg/m²) with obesity, comprising 36 males and 35 females (male/female ratio ≈ 1.03:1). Participants were categorized into four groups based on their self-reported training regimens: dietary-only (Group C), aerobic fat oxidation (Group F), high-intensity interval training (Group H), and resistance training (Group R). Subjects followed their specialized routines through online and offline sources for at least 12 weeks. Groups F, H, and R demonstrated statistically lower body weight as well as waist-to-hip ratio and body fat percent levels, when assessed against Group C (P < 0.01). The combination of resistance training with specific benefits produced larger reductions in waist-to-hip ratio, together with android fat mass, primarily observed among male participants (P < 0.01). The participants in Group H demonstrated the greatest decrease in body fat percentage among female subjects (P < 0.01), even though Group R participants achieved beneficial results, although their adherence level was less than ideal. Participants from all experimental groups maintained similar levels of muscle mass. The hybrid online and offline approach effectively enhanced adherence and engagement, demonstrating its scalability and potential for managing obesity.",2025,[],[]
Metabolic Alterations in Women with Lipedema Compared to Women with Lifestyle-Induced Overweight/Obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lipedema is a chronic disorder characterized by disproportionate fat accumulation in the extremities, predominantly affecting women. Unlike obesity, lipedema might be associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic alterations despite often coexisting with overweight or obesity. Fat distribution plays a crucial role in metabolic differences, with gynoid fat in lipedema being associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. The present study aims to compare biochemical parameters between women with lipedema and those with lifestyle-induced overweight/obesity. <b>Methods</b>: This study involved 108 women, including 53 with lipedema and 55 with lifestyle-induced overweight/obesity. Anthropometric measurements and body composition analyses were conducted, and biochemical parameters related to liver function, lipid profile, kidney and thyroid function, uric acid levels, and carbohydrate metabolism were assessed. Statistical comparisons were made between groups, and multivariate models were used to explore the relationships between disease type, metabolic parameters, and body composition. <b>Results</b>: Women with lipedema exhibited a more favorable metabolic profile than those with overweight/obesity. Dyslipidemia was observed in ~50% of the lipedema group, compared to nearly 70% in the overweight/obesity group. Impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance were significantly less prevalent in the lipedema group (18.9% vs. 43.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions</b>: Despite having a high BMI, women with lipedema demonstrate fewer metabolic alterations than those with overweight/obesity. Fat distribution, rather than overall adiposity, appears to influence metabolic risk. These findings highlight the need for targeted therapeutic approaches to lipedema, distinct from conventional obesity management strategies.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
The Effects of Adipose Tissue Dysregulation on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Internationally, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity rates are increasing significantly. As these epidemics continue to spread, the continuation of further research is paramount given that chronic diseases, such as T2DM, cause strain on both economies and healthcare systems. Recently, adipose tissue has been identified as an endocrine organ that produces many hormones that influence many bodily processes. Adipose tissue dysregulation (ATD)-when adipokines (adipose tissue hormones) are produced in abnormal amounts-plays an important role in T2DM development, progression, and prognosis. This narrative review focuses on mechanisms linking ATD with T2DM through adipokine actions (specifically, leptin and adiponectin) on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. Here we show that the adipokines leptin and adiponectin are valuable in monitoring, diagnosing, and treating diseases. Further, their ratio (the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio, or LAR) may be more valuable than either adipokine individually. The LAR may give researchers the ability to utilize a primary prevention approach by utilizing LAR as a biomarker influencing early prognosis and treatment. Targeting ATD through diet, weight loss, physical activity, etc., may improve prevention and management outcomes for patients living with or at risk of T2DM.",2025,"['leptin', 'adiponectin', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'adiponectin', 'leptin', 'adiponectin']","['leptin', 'adiponectin', 'insulin']"
Crosstalk between Epigenetics and Autophagy in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is one of the most common causes of liver dysfunction worldwide, posing a significant economic burden. However, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of MASLD is in its early stages. Over the last two decades, epigenetic mechanisms and autophagy have emerged as two independent phenomena that control cellular and molecular processes in health and disease. Epigenetic events and defects in autophagy have been linked with the pathogenesis of MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in cellular studies, mouse models, and human research. However, the connection between epigenetic mechanisms and autophagy regulation in MASLD and MASH pathogenesis remains unclear. This review highlights the importance of epigenetic modifications and their regulatory switches in controlling downstream pathways that significantly impact metabolic disease pathogenesis. We also review the need to identify key epigenetic factors regulating autophagy in MASLD and MASH pathogenesis. Such insights could aid the development of novel strategies to restore autophagy and improve disease outcomes.",2025,[],[]
Pathogenetic therapeutic approaches for endocrine diseases based on antisense oligonucleotides and RNA-interference.,"Molecular therapy uses nucleic acid-based therapeutics agents and becomes a promising alternative for disease conditions unresponsive to traditional pharmaceutical approaches. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are two well-known strategies used to modulate gene expression. RNA-targeted therapy can precisely modulate the function of target RNA with minimal off-target effects and can be rationally designed based on sequence data. ASOs and siRNA-based drugs have unique capabilities for using in target groups of patients or can be tailored as patient-customized N-of-1 therapeutic approach. Antisense therapy can be utilized not only for the treatment of monogenic diseases but also holds significant promise for addressing polygenic and complex diseases by targeting key genes and molecular pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. In the context of endocrine disorders, molecular therapy is particularly effective in modulating pathogenic mechanisms such as defective insulin signaling, beta-cell dysfunction and hormonal imbalances. Furthermore, siRNA and ASOs have the ability to downregulate overactive signaling pathways that contribute to complex, non-monogenic endocrine disorders, thereby addressing these conditions at their molecular origin. ASOs are also being studied worldwide as unique candidates for developing therapies for N-of-1 therapies. The sequence-specific ASOs binding provides exceptional accuracy in N-of-1 approaches, when the oligonucleotide can be targeted to a patient's exact mutant sequence. In this review we focus on diseases of the endocrine system and discuss potential RNA-targeted therapeutic opportunities in diabetes mellitus, including monogenic beta cell diabetes, and obesity, including syndrome obesity and monogenic obesity, as well as in non-monogenic or complex endocrine disorders. We also provide an overview of currently developed and available antisense molecules, and describe potentials of antisense-based therapeutics for the treatment of rare and «ultrarare» endocrine diseases.",2025,"['as', 'insulin', 'as', '##os', 'asos']",['insulin']
An evaluation of a community-based intervention in England aiming to reduce inequalities in exercise participation.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Exercise referral schemes are a common intervention that seek to address physical inactivity. There is limited evidence on whether they can address the inequalities in inactivity associated with income, age, and gender. A novel intervention that sought to address barriers to the uptake of physical activity schemes including access, cost, and specific health and social needs of participants was evaluated in a mixed methods study.<h4>Methods</h4>Serial qualitative interviews with participants were conducted across three time points over the six-month intervention and the routine outcome data collected by the delivery partner were statistically analysed after stratification for referral route, demographic and socioeconomic status and engagement. Data from non-participants in the intervention from the targeted community were collected through street intercept surveys. A descriptive cost analysis was undertaken to understand the cost of delivery.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>The study found small improvements in health outcomes and engagement.

Gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and MetS-related nephropathy.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of complex disorders characterized by abnormalities in the metabolism of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and other substances in the human body. The kidney plays a vital role in these metabolic processes. Similarly, metabolic disorders can lead to renal damage, which can affect both its structure and function. The human intestinal tract possesses an abundant and diverse gut microbial community that significantly influences the physiology and pathology of the host. Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota-derived metabolites exhibit multiple effects (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and improvement of lipid metabolism) in MetS. Particularly, considerable research has suggested that gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have an intimate relationship with MetS-related nephropathy. The functions of SCFAs are involved in modulating energy metabolism, regulating immune and inflammatory responses, and inhibiting oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, which are mainly through the activation of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) and the inhibition of Histone deacetylase activity (HDAC). Regarding MetS-related nephropathy, therapeutic studies of SCFAs have been conducted in both clinical investigations and animal experiments. However, the role of SCFAs in kidney damage caused by various metabolic disorders has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this article is to review the role of SCFAs in MetS-related nephropathy, which will provide a prospective therapy strategy for MetS-related nephropathy.",2025,"['transmembrane g protein - coupled receptors', 'gprs', 'histone deacetylase', 'hdac', 's']","['histone deacetylase', 'hdac']"
Development of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Grade-Based Framework on the Pharmacological Treatment of Obesity: Design and Methodological Aspects,"<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> <h4>Aim</h4> To describe the design and methodological aspects of the upcoming European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Framework for the Pharmacological Treatment of Obesity utilizing currently available evidence. <h4>Methods</h4> An expert panel of 13 members, selected by EASO, developed the framework using the GRADE methodology to ensure transparent, evidence-based guideline development. Clinical questions were formulated using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) framework, focusing on the effectiveness and safety of European Medicines Agency-approved obesity management medications (OMM), including orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted using Medline and Embase, including randomized controlled trials with a minimum duration of 48 weeks. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses will be conducted to compare treatment effectiveness and safety profiles across various patient subgroups. <h4>Results</h4> The guidelines will target adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m 2 and at least one weight-related comorbidity or a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 . The primary endpoint will be total body weight loss (TBWL%). Secondary outcomes will be changes in body composition (i.e., fat mass, fat-free mass), metabolic improvements (i.e., glucose levels, HbA1c, lipid profile), remission of obesity-related comorbidities (i.e., type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and knee osteoarthritis), and improvements in mental health and quality of life. Preliminary analyses suggest that this framework will provide structured, individualized treatment recommendations based on the latest evidence. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The EASO framework aims to optimize pharmacological treatment for obesity through an individualized, evidence-based approach. By integrating clinical efficacy, safety outcomes, and patient-specific factors, these guidelines will support healthcare professionals in improving obesity management and its related comorbidities.",2025,"['h', '##1c']",[]
Postoperative Weight Loss After Antiobesity Medications and Revision Risk After Joint Replacement.,"<h4>Importance</h4>The 2023 American College of Rheumatology and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons Clinical Practice Guideline concluded that obesity alone should not delay joint replacement. Therefore, a substantially increased utilization of joint replacement among patients with obesity could be expected. However, patients with obesity are at increased risk of revision, posing unique challenges as the surgery is complex and costly, and it remains unknown whether postoperative weight loss could decrease the risk of revision.<h4>Objective</h4>To examine the association of the proportion of postoperative weight loss following antiobesity medication use with the risk of revision among patients with obesity undergoing hip or knee replacement.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>Using a target trial emulation, a causal inference framework, this retrospective cohort study investigated patients with obesity who underwent hip or knee replacement. Data were from the IQVIA Medical Research Database (2000-2023). Statistical analysis was performed from October 2023 to June 2024.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Emulated analyses of a hypothetical target trial were assessed for the association of small-to-moderate (2%-10%) or large (≥10%) weight loss after initiating antiobesity medications (orlistat, sibutramine, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and rimonabant) within 1 year with the risk of 5-year and 10-year revision after initiation of antiobesity medications.<h4>Results</h4>Among 3691 qualified participants (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [9.3] years; 2322 [62.9%] women), the 5-year risks of revision were 5.6%, 4.4%, and 3.7% for weight gain or stable, small-to-moderate weight loss, and large weight loss groups, respectively. Compared with the weight gain or stable group, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.04) for the small-to-moderate weight loss group and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.36-0.91) for the large weight loss group. Similar results were observed when the analyses were performed separately for hip or knee replacement. The HRs for revision were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.32-0.93) for small-to-moderate weight loss and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.25-0.97) for large weight loss groups compared with the weight gain or stable group in patients undergoing knee replacement; the corresponding HRs for revision were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.54-1.25) and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.30-0.93) in patients undergoing hip replacement. Consistent findings were obtained regarding the association of weight loss with the 10-year risks after initiating antiobesity medications.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>In this cohort study using a target trial emulation, a higher proportion of weight loss after initiating antiobesity medications within 1 year was associated with a lower risk of 5-year and 10-year revision among patients with obesity undergoing joint replacement. These results suggest that antiobesity medication use, with relatively safe and sustainable weight loss, may be an effective strategy for improving implant survivorship of hip and knee replacements in the obese population.",2025,['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor'],['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
The Impact and Safety of GLP-1 Agents and Breast Cancer.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity and breast cancer rates are increasing globally, with obesity prevalence more than doubling since 1990. By 2022, 44% of women were overweight, and 18% were obese. Breast cancer remains the most common malignancy among women, with 2.2 million new cases in 2020. A significant proportion of breast cancer patients are overweight or obese at diagnosis, which is associated with higher recurrence and mortality rates. Recently, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have emerged as remarkably effective weight loss drugs. Understanding the relationship between obesity, breast cancer, and weight loss is crucial for improving patient outcomes.<h4>Methodology</h4>A comprehensive review of literature from 1996 to 2024 was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science. Studies included epidemiological data on obesity and breast cancer incidence, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical trials on weight management interventions (behavioral modification, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological treatments) for breast cancer patients. Preclinical studies examining the biological mechanisms linking obesity and breast cancer progression were also reviewed.<h4>Results</h4>Epidemiological studies consistently show that overweight and obese post-menopausal women have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Obesity at diagnosis is linked to worse outcomes, including higher disease recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. Weight gain during treatment, particularly with chemotherapy, is common and often leads to sarcopenic obesity. Behavioral interventions have shown modest weight loss but are difficult to maintain. Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but lacks data on its impact on tumor characteristics and recurrence. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide and tirzepatide have demonstrated significant weight loss in non-cancer populations, but their safety and efficacy in breast cancer patients are not well established.<h4>Discussion</h4>The biology underlying obesity's role in breast cancer progression involves complex interactions between adipocytokines, hormones, and inflammatory cytokines. Weight loss interventions have potential benefits, but sustaining weight reduction in breast cancer patients is challenging. The emerging pharmacological treatments, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists, show promise for effective weight management but require further investigation to confirm their safety and impact on breast cancer outcomes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Addressing obesity in breast cancer patients is critical for improving prognosis and quality of life. While current data do not suggest adverse safety signals with GLP-1 receptor agonists, more research is needed to fully understand their effects. Effective, safe, and sustainable weight management strategies are urgently needed to support breast cancer patients.",2025,"['glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 receptor', 'glp', '- 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 receptor']","['glp 1 receptor', 'glp']"

Photosensitive Biomimetic Nanomedicine-Mediated Recombination of Adipose Microenvironments for Antiobesity Therapy.,"Obesity-induced insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, and chronic low-grade inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance through the activation of tissue-infiltrating immune cells. Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity-related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light-responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual-targeting and multiple-signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1-like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs-mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high-fat diet (HFD)-induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long-term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light-sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Obesity and Lifestyle Drift: Framing Analysis of Calorie Menu Labelling in England in News Media.,"<h4>Background</h4>Successive government public health strategies in England have described structural influences of diet-related ill health, including obesity, while emphasising the solution of individual-level change in policy documents. This entrenchment of an individualistic policy paradigm, despite communicating a recognition of structural determinants of health on paper, has been termed ""lifestyle drift."" The 2020 government strategy, <i>Tackling Obesity</i>, included policies to address structural determinants of health like the physical and digital food environments but ultimately failed to shift responsibility for diet-related ill health onto structural factors. This study uses the contestation of calorie labelling (CL) in the out-of-home (OOH) sector, one of the strategy's only two implemented measures, in English newspapers to investigate how the policy is framed, and the potential role of media framing in facilitating lifestyle drift.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically searched the Factiva database for articles from 12 UK national newspapers that discussed CL between January 2017 and May 2022, and assessed them relative to inclusion criteria. We then used a combination of reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) and framing theory to qualitatively analyse the framing of policy problems and the solutions meant to address them.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 177 articles met our criteria. We found that media framing often reinforced individualism, personal responsibility, and moralisation of behaviour. It also emphasised perceived mixed and inconclusive evidence of CL's effectiveness, unfairness to businesses, and unintended consequences, including negative impacts on the economy and people living with eating disorders.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite an initial shift towards framing interventions to address obesity through a structural lens in <i>Tackling Obesity</i>, CL legislation and accompanying news coverage reflected a drift back towards individualism. To enact effective, structural change to address diet-related public health issues, policy discourses and approaches need to move away from individualising and moralising framing of both public health problems and potential solutions.",2025,[],[]
Lipid Hormones at the Intersection of Metabolic Imbalances and Endocrine Disorders.,"Lipid hormone imbalances involving glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones (THs), and sex hormones have widespread metabolic consequences, contributing to the global increase in obesity and insulin resistance. This review examines the complex role of disrupted lipid hormone pathways in the development of metabolic disorders, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Endocrine disorders such as hypercortisolism, hypothyroidism, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are closely linked to MASLD through shared metabolic pathways. Mechanisms include glucocorticoid-induced gluconeogenesis and lipolysis, impaired lipid clearance in hypothyroidism, and the hyperandrogenism-induced downregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. PCOS-related factors-such as central obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy, low adiponectin levels, and genetic predisposition-further promote hepatic steatosis. Thyroid dysfunction may also impair the hepatic deiodination of T4, contributing to lipid accumulation and inflammation. Given the overlapping pathophysiology among endocrine, hepatic, and reproductive disorders, multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to optimize diagnosis, treatment, and long-term cardiometabolic outcomes.",2025,"['insulin', 'hepatic low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) receptors', 'adiponectin']","['insulin', 'adiponectin']"

Optimizing energy balance in youth: reducing sugar-sweetened beverages and screen time.,"The high prevalence of children and adolescents living with obesity, as well as the multitude of associated risks, stress the need for refined weight management strategies for this population. While an overarching lifestyle intervention may be an ideal way to improve energy balance, more practical recommendations would likely improve adherence rates. This review set out to investigate sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and screen time as potential lifestyle targets to reduce paediatric obesity. We report strong evidence that both sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and screen time influence childhood obesity directly, as well as through interactions with sleep patterns. Potential mechanisms are discussed with focus on the energy balance framework of obesity. We also present methodological considerations to improve applicability and consistency of future studies.",2025,[],[]
Trends in metabolic risk factors control among adults with type 2 diabetes: A comparative study of 2018 and 2021.,"<h4>Aims</h4>This study aims to analyze recent trends in managing major metabolic risk factors among type 2 diabetes patients (T2D) over time.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data from the Danish Adult Diabetes Registry (DVDD) on health indicators in 2018 and 2021. Information about medication was found using Danish National Prescription Registry (DNPR). Cut points for abnormal values of the included health indicators were identified from the revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Correspondingly, reached target levels were defined. A logistic regression model based on generalized estimating equations was fitted to evaluate the difference between 2018 and 2021.<h4>Results</h4>We included 24,343 and 18,027 observations in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Longitudinal analyses showed statistically significant improvement in Low density lipoprotein, Blood pressure, triglycerides, and Glycated hemoglobin control overtime. The use of glucose-lowering and lipid-lowering medications, and antihypertensive medication increased. Obesity declined significantly overtime. Subgroup analyses highlighted improvement in metabolic control across age groups, with TG control declining in T2D patients over 60 years.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found statistically significant improvement in metabolic risk factor control and medication use over time. Despite progress in managing LDL, BP, and HbA1c, challenges remain in Blood pressure and triglycerides control.",2025,"['low density lipoprotein', 'glycated hemoglobin', 'l', 'hba1c']","['low density lipoprotein', 'glycated hemoglobin', 'hba1c']"
&lt;i&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/i&gt; and osteoporosis: emerging role of gut microbiota in skeletal homeostasis.,"Osteoporosis (OP) is a prevalent age-related skeletal disease. It is marked by compromised bone strength and higher fracture risk. Emerging evidence ties gut dysbiosis to OP development. Yet, the exact role of specific commensal bacteria remains unclear. Here, we review how <i>Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila)</i> affects bone metabolism. This mucin-degrading bacterium acts through three well-documented mechanisms: metabolite signaling, immune modulation, and gut-bone axis crosstalk. We also discuss emerging factors, such as host metabolic status, mechanical loading, and biomaterial applications. First, <i>A. muciniphila</i> produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs: acetate, propionate, butyrate), bile-acid metabolites, and vitamin K2. These substances boost Runx2-mediated osteoblast (OB) differentiation. They also suppress NF-κB-driven osteoclastogenesis. Second, the bacterium restores gut immune balance. It does so by expanding Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells and shifting macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. It also down-regulates IL-6, TNF-α, and RANKL signaling, thus limiting bone resorption. Third, via the gut-bone axis, <i>A. muciniphila</i>-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and miRNAs (e.g., miR-214-3p) enter the bloodstream. They strengthen intestinal barrier integrity, regulate calcium-phosphorus balance, and reduce systemic inflammation. Findings on <i>A. muciniphila</i> and bone health are conflicting. Some clinical and animal studies link higher abundance to better bone mass, with depletion worsening OP. Others, however, report negative correlations between <i>A. muciniphila</i> levels and bone mineral density (BMD) in separate cohorts. Most data come from pre-clinical models. Long-term human studies are scarce, and no clear causal links have been established. Future research should focus on randomized controlled trials. These trials need to define strain-specific effects, optimal doses, and safety profiles. The goal is to resolve these inconsistencies and turn <i>A. muciniphila</i>-based approaches into precise therapies for preventing and treating OP.",2025,"['m', '##ucin', 'runx2', 'nf - κb', 'foxp3', 'm2', 'il - 6', 'tnf - α', 'rankl', 'mir - 214 - 3p']","['runx2', 'foxp3', 'rankl']"
Cistanoside F Ameliorates Lipid Accumulation and Enhances Myogenic Differentiation via AMPK-Dependent Signaling in C2C12 Myotubes.,"Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a metabolic disorder for which no effective pharmacological treatments are currently available. Cistanoside F (Cis), a phenoxyethanol-derived compound, remains relatively unexplored in the context of lipid metabolism regulation, as well as its potential mechanisms and therapeutic applications in metabolic disorders. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of Cis in ameliorating the pathological manifestations of SO in C2C12 cells. Two classical adipogenic differentiation models using C2C12 cells were employed to quantitatively assess the ability of Cis to inhibit lipid droplet formation, utilizing Oil Red O staining coupled with high-content imaging analysis. Markers associated with adipogenic and myogenic differentiation were examined using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Our experimental findings demonstrated that Cis significantly attenuated lipid droplet accumulation and promoted muscle protein synthesis via the modulation of PPARγ, ATGL, CPT1b, and UCP1 expression during lipogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Cis significantly upregulated the phosphorylation and expression levels of key metabolic regulators, including p-AMPK/AMPK, p-ACC1/ACC1, and MHC. We identified a positive regulatory feedback mechanism between AMPK signaling and MHC expression in the adipogenic differentiation model, suggesting that Cis exerts its therapeutic effects through AMPK-dependent pathways. This is the first study to provide the first experimental evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of Cis for metabolic regulation, targeting adiposity reduction and muscle mass enhancement. Furthermore, Cis exhibited potent anti-inflammatory properties, as demonstrated by its ability to significantly downregulate proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6 and p-NF-κB/NF-κB, during adipogenic differentiation. These novel findings regarding the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Cis will form the basis for our subsequent in-depth mechanistic investigations.",2025,"['pparγ', 'atgl', 'cpt1b', 'ucp1', 'p - ampk', 'ampk', 'p - acc1', 'acc1', 'mhc', 'ampk', 'mhc', 'ampk', 'il - 6', 'p - nf - κb', 'nf - κb']","['pparγ', 'atgl', 'cpt1b', 'ucp1', 'ampk', 'acc1', 'mhc']"
Liver fat mediates hippocampal-orbitofrontal reward circuit disruption and cognitive-emotional impairments in MASLD.,"<h4>Background</h4>As a major chronic liver condition, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is linked to numerous extrahepatic manifestations, including cognitive and emotional dysfunction. However, its neuroanatomical and functional brain correlates remain unclear. This study investigates cerebral alterations in MASLD by examining structural differences via voxel-based morphometry (VBM), along with functional features using resting-state functional connectivity (FC).<h4>Methods and patients</h4>Seventy-four MASLD patients and sixty-two demographically matched healthy controls (HC) underwent structural MRI and resting-state fMRI. Group differences in gray matter volume (GMV) and FC were analyzed using VBM and seed-based FC methods. Correlations and mediation analyses were further used to assess the relationships among abnormal GMV, altered resting-state FC and clinical indicators in MASLD individuals.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with MASLD exhibited reduced GMV in the bilateral hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, right supplementary motor area (SMA), and right cerebellum. Importantly, liver fat content fully mediated the effects of hippocampal atrophy on cognitive-emotional symptoms. Seed-based FC analysis further revealed decreased connectivity between the right hippocampus and the right orbitofrontal cortex. This reduction in connectivity was also associated with worse cognitive function and a higher waist-to-hip ratio.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MASLD-related brain atrophy and functional disruption are linked to visceral adiposity and neuropsychiatric deficits. The mediating role of liver fat highlights the importance of dual-pathway interventions that target both metabolic health and neural protection, potentially reducing long-term neurocognitive disability burdens and enabling accessible risk stratification in practice.",2025,[],[]
"Obesity, overweight and breast cancer: new clinical data and implications for practice.","Excess bodyweight has negative consequences in breast cancer (BC) patients, significantly increasing the incidence of BC and adversely affecting clinical outcomes in most BC subtypes. This article overviews recent evidence relating to excess bodyweight (particularly obesity) and its effect on treatment in women with BC, focusing on latest evidence, including clinical findings from recently introduced new therapeutic entities. There is evidence of an inverse relationship between obesity and BC in premenopausal women highlighting a complex interplay involving the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells, and patient factors such as hormonal/metabolic/inflammatory status. Advancements in targeted- and immune-therapy have brought renewed optimism for women with BC. Ultimately, a better understanding of the mechanistic link between adipogenicity and tumorigenicity in breast tissues, as well as how obesity and adipose tissue inflammation interact with female sex hormones, may prove to be an important area for further refinements in our quest to develop a truly personalized therapeutic approach in this clinical setting.",2025,[],[]

Self-regulation and behavioral risk factors for obesity in youth facing multiple adversities.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the extent to which different facets of self-regulation, including emotion regulation and executive functioning, relate to three target health behaviors associated with obesity risk (i.e., eating, physical activity, and sleep) in youth facing multiple adversities.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants included youth (10-18 years) and their caregivers. Emotion regulation, executive functioning, and subjective health behaviors were measured via self- and proxy-report. Disinhibited eating was assessed objectively. Caregivers reported on sociodemographic and risk indicators. Regression analyses were used to examine associations between self-regulation and health behaviors.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 174 youth and their caregivers enrolled in the study. Youth experienced overall high levels of socioeconomic, academic, and health hardships, as well as high levels of caregiver-reported executive dysfunction. Self-reported emotion regulation difficulties were consistently associated with greater self-reported reward-based eating and sleep disturbances, with effect sizes varying from small to large. Only one facet of emotion regulation, difficulties with emotional awareness, was inversely associated with self-reported physical activity. Caregiver-reported executive functioning was not related to health behaviors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current study highlights the potential role of emotion regulation in obesity prevention efforts and identifies unique associations between specific facets of emotion regulation and health behaviors among youth exposed to adversity. Public health and obesity prevention efforts that target emotion regulation and coping skills may be particularly beneficial in promoting health behaviors in this population. Findings underscore the need for future research to examine how broader, multi-level contextual factors influence self-regulation, shape youth's health behaviors, and contribute to long-term obesity risk.",2025,[],[]
Diet therapy for the management of obesity in children and adolescents: Overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"This overview of reviews analyzes the impact of diet therapy in the treatment of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents 0-19 years of age. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, Medline, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in obesity treatment from June 2016 to November 2022 were retrieved. Obesity outcomes included body weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, among others. Twenty-three reviews on diet therapy and lifestyle interventions including diet were selected from 364 review records. Diet therapy showed limited effect on short-term obesity reduction. Moderate energy intake reduction (-500 kcal/day) with balanced diet was feasible and effective in obesity reduction in 6- to 18-year-olds, irrespective of macronutrient distribution. Very low-energy diet (≤800 kcal/day) should only be prescribed under strict monitoring. Diet as part of multicomponent lifestyle interventions may be beneficial in achieving small, short- to long-term reductions in body weight in children and adolescents across all age groups and settings. Obesity treatment in adolescents may improve self-esteem and health-related quality of life. Dietary strategies should focus on the reduction of total energy intake through the promotion of food-based initiatives/approaches guidance that target modification of usual eating patterns and behaviors.",2025,[],[]
From gut microbial ecology to lipid homeostasis: Decoding the role of gut microbiota in dyslipidemia pathogenesis and intervention.,"Dyslipidemia, a complex disorder characterized by systemic lipid profile abnormalities, affects more than half of adults globally and constitutes a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mounting evidence has established the gut microbiota (GM) as a pivotal metabolic modulator that is correlated with atherogenic lipid profiles through dietary biotransformation, immunometabolic regulation, and bioactive metabolite signaling. However, the host-microbe interactions that drive dyslipidemia pathogenesis involve complex gene-environment crosstalk spanning epigenetic modifications to circadian entrainment. Mechanistically, GM perturbations disrupt lipid homeostasis <i>via</i> lipopolysaccharide-triggered hepatic very low-density lipoprotein overproduction, short-chain fatty acid-G protein-coupled receptor 43/41-mediated adipocyte lipolysis, bile acid-farnesoid X receptor/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 axis dysfunction altering cholesterol flux, microbial β-oxidation intermediates impairing mitochondrial energetics, and host-microbiota non-coding RNA crosstalk regulating lipogenic genes. This comprehensive review systematically examines three critical dimensions, including bidirectional GM-lipid axis interactions, molecular cascades bridging microbial ecology to metabolic dysfunction, and translational applications of GM modulation through precision probiotics, structure-specific prebiotics, and a metabolically optimized fecal microbiota transplantation protocol. Notwithstanding these advances, critical gaps persist in establishing causal microbial taxa-pathway relationships and optimal intervention timing. Future directions require longitudinal multi-omic studies, gnotobiotic models for mechanistic validation, and machine learning-driven personalized microbiota profiling. This synthesis provides a framework for developing microbiota-centric strategies targeting dyslipidemia pathophysiology, with implications for precision dyslipidemia management and next-generation cardiovascular disease prevention.",2025,"['very low - density lip', '##rotein', 'short - chain fatty acid - g protein - coupled receptor 43 / 41', 'bile acid - farnesoid x receptor', 'takeda g protein - coupled receptor 5']",[]
"The Relationship Between Modeling, Caregiver Education, and Diverse Diet in Costa Rican Preschool Children.","<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Previous literature shows that the demographic characteristics of caregivers, such as educational level, determine health processes in young children. However, the mechanisms through which educational level increases health in this population have scarcely been explored in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Evidence also suggests that caregivers who model healthy eating to their children, such as eating healthy foods in front of them or enjoying the consumption of healthy foods, increase the likelihood that their child will do the same. <b>Methods:</b> Eighty-two primary caregivers of children between 3 and 5 years of age in Costa Rica completed an electronic questionnaire with measures on the highest educational level attained, modeling the healthy eating and diet diversity of their children. Diet diversity indicates the intake of seven important groups of macronutrients that are needed for healthy development in Costa Rican children. <b>Results:</b> To investigate these relationships, a simple mediation analysis was carried out, with diet diversity as an outcome, caregiver educational level as a predictor, and modeling as a mediator. The indirect effect of educational level on diet diversity was found to be statistically significant [Effect size = 0.10, 95% C.I. (0.01-0.20)]; <b>Conclusions:</b> Results indicate that high educational level is associated with increased usage of healthy eating modeling with children, and this in turn is positively related to their diet being more diverse. Results suggest that the modeling of healthy eating could be the object of interventions aimed at preventing obesity in Costa Rican children.",2025,[],[]
Anti-Obesity Effect of Liposomal Suspension and Extracts of &lt;i&gt;Hibiscus sabdariffa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt; in a Murine Model Fed a Hypercaloric Diet.,"<h4>Background/objectives</h4>Obesity is the primary risk factor for the development of chronic degenerative diseases. Multidisciplinary treatments target multiple pathologies associated with obesity. In this study, a potential adjuvant therapy was evaluated by combining extracts from Hibiscus <i>sabdariffa</i> and <i>Zingiber officinale</i>. These extracts were used in both a simple and liposomal suspension, the latter aimed at enhancing the activity of phenolic compounds and determining various metabolic benefits.<h4>Methods</h4>In this research, the use of biotechnological approaches for the development of a liposomal suspension formulation with appropriate characteristics of stability, particle size, polydispersity index, concentration, and zeta potential induced an effective reduction in body weight and epididymal fat in a murine obesity model over 8 and 45 days.<h4>Results</h4>Treatment with the liposomal suspension reduced variables in the lipid profile, aspartate aminotransferase activity, and energy expenditure, while also promoting an increase in locomotor activity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Therefore, it is suggested that the liposomal suspension represents an alternative for obesity treatment and the reduction of cardiovascular risks.",2025,['aspartate aminotransferase'],['aspartate aminotransferase']
The Impact of Digital Technologies in Shaping Weight Loss Motivation Among Children and Adolescents.,"<h4>Background/aim</h4>Child and adolescent obesity is currently one of the most pressing public health challenges. Digital technology-based interventions are becoming increasingly important in supporting weight loss motivation and promoting healthy lifestyles. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of technology tools on the BMI (body mass index) and their impact on health attitudes in children and adolescents.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The study was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, analysing studies published between 2011 and 2024 on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Of the 1475 articles identified and analysed, 59 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed based on the type of technology used, the type of intervention, family involvement, the level of personalisation and their impact on BMI and motivation.<h4>Results</h4>The systematic review showed that digital technologies-in particular mobile apps, wearables and m-health platforms-can effectively support weight reduction and improved eating habits in children and adolescents. The most beneficial results were observed in interventions that were personalised and included caregiver support. In addition, digital technology was shown to have a positive impact on participants' psychological well-being.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Digital technology-based interventions can be an effective tool in the prevention and treatment of obesity in children and adolescents. However, their success depends on a comprehensive approach that includes psychological, social and cognitive developmental factors.",2025,[],[]

Computerised Algorithms Showed Promise in Identifying Swedish Children With Atypical Growth Patterns.,"<h4>Aim</h4>We used computerised algorithms comparing the performance of the growth assessment criteria recommended in Sweden with those used in Finland and established by the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF).<h4>Methods</h4>Historical data from 3214 Swedish children (51.6% girls) at 4, 6, and 8 years of age were compared with five Finnish screening parameters: the height standard deviation score (height-SDS), body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), differences in those over time and deviations from target height. In addition, BMI cut-offs in the Swedish, Finnish, and IOTF growth references were compared.<h4>Results</h4>The Finnish screening algorithms identified up to 1.8% of Swedish children with low height-SDS or a negative change in height-SDS, and up to 1.5% with high height-SDS or a positive change in height-SDS. They also identified 26.4% more children with BMI corresponding to underweight, overweight or obesity than the IOTF measure. The Swedish cut-off identified a larger proportion than the Finnish algorithms: 17.4% of boys and 13.6% of girls were short at 4 years of age, while 15.5% of boys and 18.6% of girls were tall. Most children with atypical values were identified by this age.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Computerised Finnish algorithms could identify Swedish children with atypical growth patterns.",2025,[],[]

Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II Inhibitors Mitigate High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity in Mice.,"Calcium signaling contributes to obesity and its related disorders, such as diabetes. We herein investigated the effects of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors on diet-induced obesity in mice. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), the administration of the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 and the glycolipid acremomannolipin A with the suppression of CaMKII phosphorylation reduced fat mass in the whole body, epididymal and subcutaneous white adipose tissue weights, and lipid accumulation in epididymal and subcutaneous white adipose tissues, but not muscle mass or bone mineral density at the tibia. Moreover, the administration of KN-93 and acremomannolipin A improved glucose intolerance in HFD-fed mice. In an in vitro study on preadipocytic 3T3-L1 cells and mouse adipose tissue-derived stromal cells, KN-93 and acremomannolipin A suppressed adipogenic differentiation, proliferation, and lipid accumulation. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that CaMKII inhibitors mitigated the development of diet-induced obesity in mice partly through the suppression of adipogenic differentiation, cell proliferation, and lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Inhibiting CaMKII could be a potential strategy for obesity treatment.",2025,"['calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii', 'camkii', 'camkii', 'kn - 93', 'acremomannolipin a', 'camkii', 'kn', 'acremomannolipin a', 'acremomannolipin a', 'camkii', 'camkii']","['calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii', 'camkii', 'kn 93', 'acremomannolipin a']"
Cumulative behavioral and metabolic determinants of health are associated with higher inflammation-related indices: insights from a cross-sectional study (NHANES 2005-2018).,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study innovatively investigates the cumulative associations between behavioral determinants of health (BDoH), metabolic determinants of health (MDoH), and systemic inflammation biomarkers in U.S. adults, using a novel cross-sectional framework to quantify their synergistic effects.<h4>Methods</h4>Utilizing cross-sectional data from 18,500 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005-2018 cycle), we developed a composite exposure model integrating BDoH (smoking status, physical activity, dietary quality) and MDoH (obesity metrics, hypertension, diabetes) through standardized questionnaires and clinical measurements. Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) were calculated from peripheral blood cell counts. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models examined dose-response relationships, with trend analysis explicitly testing cumulative BDoH-MDoH interactions.<h4>Results</h4>The cohort (mean age 44.3 ± 0.3 years; 52.4% male) demonstrated significant positive associations between adverse health determinants and inflammatory indices. Current tobacco use (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.18-1.47), suboptimal diet (HEI < 52: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.11-1.38), obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>: OR = 1.41, 95%CI = 1.27-1.56), and central adipometry (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.25-1.54) showed strongest correlations with elevated SII/SIRI. Metabolic disorders exhibited distinct patterns: hypertension and diabetes associated specifically with SIRI elevation (OR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.06-1.33 and OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.03-1.32, respectively), while physical inactivity (<600 MET-min/week) uniquely correlated with SII increase (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.13-1.40). Notably, our cumulative model revealed synergistic effects: exposure to ≥3 adverse behavioral determinants amplified inflammation risks (SII: OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.42-1.73; SIRI: OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.35-1.64), with significant dose-dependent trends (P-trend<0.001). Co-occurring metabolic abnormalities demonstrated additive inflammatory effects (P-trend<0.001), exceeding individual risk factor impacts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This cross-sectional study provides the first evidence that integrated BDoH-MDoH cumulative exposure models uncover distinct and synergistic inflammatory pathways. Both individual and combined behavioral-metabolic risk factors significantly associate with systemic inflammation biomarker elevation, highlighting the necessity of dual-target intervention strategies.",2025,[],[]
The Gut Microbiome Obesity Index: A New Analytical Tool in the Metagenomics Workflow for the Evaluation of Gut Dysbiosis in Obese Humans.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Our aim was to create a new method for analyzing metagenomics data, named the gut microbiome obesity index, using a set of taxa/biological functions that correlated with BMI. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 109 obese patients (73 women and 36 men, median BMI 43.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 87 healthy control (HC) individuals (39 females and 48 males, median BMI 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and 109 esports players (five females and 104 males, median BMI 23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were included in the study. To conduct metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, DNA and selected metabolites were isolated from fecal samples and used for whole-genome shotgun sequencing and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, respectively. <b>Results</b>: Compared with HCs and esports players, obese patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> had a significantly higher alpha diversity, as analyzed by the Shannon index, and significant dissimilarities in beta diversity. Both richness and diversity measures were correlated with BMI. Compared with HCs and esports players, 12 differential bacteria were found in the overall obesity group and 42 were found in those with a BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Most of the altered species belonged to the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family. When the logarithmic relationship of the sums of the bacteria correlated with BMI was calculated to establish a taxonomic health index, it better differentiated between the obesity groups than a standard analytical pipeline; however, it did not differentiate between the HC and the BMI < 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> obesity group. Therefore, we created a functional index based on BMI-associated biological pathways, which differentiated between all obesity groups. <b>Conclusions</b>: Of the obesity indices used to distinguish between healthy and obese microbiota analyzed in this study, a function-based index was more useful than a taxonomy-based index. We believe that gut microbiome indexes could be useful as part of routine metagenomics evaluations. However, an index developed in one geographical area might not be applicable to individuals in a different region and, therefore, further studies should develop separate indices for different populations or geographical regions rather than relying on a single index.",2025,[],[]
A Group Motivational Interviewing intervention in schools to reduce sugar sweetened beverages intake among young people (DISS): a feasibility study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Child obesity is a global public health issue affecting high, middle and low-income countries. The causes of obesity are complex and influenced by environmental and behavioural factors including diet and sedentary lifestyles. Young people consume sugar sweetened drinks (SSB) regularly, providing the largest single source of free sugars in the UK. This paper presents the protocol for a cluster feasibility study that aims to assess feasibility of a school obesity intervention delivered by teachers to reduce SSB consumption among 12-13-year-olds in secondary schools to prevent weight gain by using Group Motivational Interviewing.<h4>Methods</h4>An exploratory mixed-methods design will be used. The aim is to recruit six schools (two control and four intervention) in East London and around 720 pupils. The intervention consists of three components. First, teachers will be upskilled in group motivational interviewing to deliver a series of activities to young people during school time. Second, a mobile app for young people will be developed to support the classroom activities. Lastly, a booklet with healthy lifestyle resources will be developed and sent home for parents. The outcome measures for the feasibility study will include the recruitment and retention rates, barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation, and acceptability among teachers and young people. Additionally, anthropometric, dietary, and lifestyle behaviour measures will be collected at baseline and at 6 months to assess acceptability in preparation for a main trial.<h4>Results</h4>The study findings will be submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed journals and shared at international conferences.<h4>Discussion</h4>The results of the study are expected to inform the development of a future trial and to contribute to research on the prevention of weight gain among young people and the reduction of SSB consumption.",2025,[],[]
Regulation of energy homeostasis by the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.,"Over the past decade, roles of the Rho family small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1 in insulin target tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, in the maintenance of energy homeostasis have been revealed. Insulin is secreted from β cells of pancreatic islets in response to the increase in blood glucose levels. Insulin binds to its receptor on the surface of target cells, triggering the activation of multiple signaling pathways in the cell. Rac1 has been identified as a key component in these signal transduction networks. In skeletal muscle, Rac1 plays a pivotal role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake from the bloodstream. In white adipocytes, in which triacylglycerol is stored as an energy source, Rac1 is also responsible for multiple physiological events related to adipogenic differentiation. As in the case of skeletal muscle, Rac1 acts as an essential regulator of glucose uptake. Recently, a pivotal role of Rac1 in fatty acid uptake has also been reported. In addition, the de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol through the transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes has been shown to be directed by Rac1. Therefore, Rac1 is considered to be a novel key player in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. In this review, I summarize recent advances in understanding the role of Rac1 in insulin signaling first in skeletal muscle and then in adipose tissue. I also discuss future prospects for potential applications in drug discovery and development.",2025,"['rho family', 'small guanosine triphosphatase rac1', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'rac1', 'rac1', 'insulin', 'rac1', 'rac1', 'rac1', 'rac1', 'rac1', 'rac1', 'insulin']","['rho family', 'insulin', 'rac1']"
"Obesity and Pregnancy: Impact on Childbirth Timing, Delivery Mode, and Maternal Recovery: An Update.","This review explores the impact of maternal obesity on pregnancy outcomes, emphasizing its significant global health challenge and profound implications for both mothers and infants. It influences the timing and mode of childbirth, elevating the risk of conditions like hypertensive disorders, cesarean delivery, and gestational diabetes mellitus. The review focuses on analyzing how maternal obesity affects postpartum recovery, birth timing, and delivery methods. Relevant studies were identified using PubMed and Scopus. Findings indicate that obese pregnant women are at higher risk for medically indicated preterm birth, scheduled and emergency cesarean sections, and labor induction. Postpartum recovery is often prolonged due to breastfeeding challenges, infection risks, and delayed wound healing. Additionally, maternal obesity increases the likelihood of fetal complications such as macrosomia and long-term metabolic disorders. These results highlight the importance of personalized treatments and early weight control to improve the health of both mother and baby. A comprehensive approach integrating clinical care, public health initiatives, and policy measures is essential to reduce pregnancy complications associated with obesity.",2025,[],[]
RNA Modification in Metabolism.,"Epigenetic regulation in disease development has been witnessed within this decade. RNA methylation is the predominant form of epigenetic regulation, and the most prevalent modification in RNA is N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A). Recently, RNA modification has emerged as a potential target for disease treatment. RNA modification is a posttranscriptional gene expression regulation that is involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Evidence suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation significantly affects RNA metabolism, and its abnormal changes have been observed in a variety of diseases. Metabolic diseases are a series of diseases caused by abnormal metabolic processes of the body, the common metabolic diseases include diabetes mellitus, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, etc.; although the pathogenesis of these diseases differs from each other to the current understanding, most recent studies suggested pivotal role m<sup>6</sup>A in modulating these metabolic diseases, and m<sup>6</sup>A-based drug development has been on the agenda. This paper reviewed recent understanding of RNA modification in metabolic diseases, hoping to provide systematic information for those in this area.",2025,[],[]
Considerations and clinical utility of referral pathways for early detection of liver disease in at-risk populations.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is the most prevalent chronic liver condition, affecting over one-third of the global population, with cirrhosis present in up to 3.3% of cases. Early detection of advanced liver disease in at-risk populations can enable timely intervention, prevent progression, and reduce complications. This review focuses on the current recommendations for early detection of advanced liver disease, evaluates the evidence for the performance of non-invasive tests in the target population for screening, and examines the multifaceted burden of screening, including economic implications and psychological impacts. Additionally, we discuss future directions, such as integrating liver health into a multidisciplinary care framework. Current guidelines recommend case-finding, targeting individuals with type 2 diabetes, metabolically complicated obesity, or persistent elevated liver enzymes. The Fibrosis-4 index is widely endorsed as a first-line non-invasive test, yet the diagnostic performance in primary care settings seems suboptimal, particularly for pre-cirrhotic disease. Sequential strategies incorporating novel non-invasive tests may improve accuracy and cost-effectiveness. Confirmation typically involves vibration-controlled transient elastography. Key challenges include a large eligible population, uncertainties in optimal screening intervals, patient adherence to follow-up, and limited real-world cost-effectiveness data. Integrating liver health assessment into cardiometabolic care pathways, reflex testing, telehealth, and patient education may enhance uptake. While challenges remain, early detection of advanced liver disease is already likely cost-effective. Ongoing advances in screening pathways and treatment options are expected to further strengthen the case for widespread implementation.",2025,[],[]
Report of a Meeting: An Expert Consultation on Body Composition and Adiposity for Children and Adolescents in All Their Diversity.,"We convened experts to discuss methods for measuring body composition and diagnosing obesity among infants, children, and adolescents aged 0-19 y. The motivation for this meeting was to inform critical decisions for a systematic review protocol to assess the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of body mass index (BMI)-for-age and sex for diagnosing infants, children, and adolescents with excessive adiposity that can impair health. Thirty-nine clinicians and researchers from 23 countries provided written responses and/or attended 1 of 2 virtual meetings held in January 2024. Experts were asked to share their perspectives about methods and clinical tests used to measure body composition, including thresholds and adiposity types (i.e., total or central), for diagnosing obesity for infants, children, and adolescents. Experts suggested that deuterium oxide dilution, magnetic resonance imaging, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, air displacement plethysmography, hydrostatic weighing, and multicompartmental models were acceptable to measure body composition, with the 4-compartmental model preferred. Waist circumference and bioelectrical impedance were preferred clinical tests to use either alone or in combination with BMI for diagnosing obesity; preferential use was country specific. Most experts preferred fat mass index (fat mass/height<sup>2</sup>) to % body fat as the metric, because it is more sensitive to changes over time and depends on age and height, similar to BMI. Experts agreed that total and regional adiposity are important for determining metabolic risk related to obesity, but using central adiposity for diagnosing obesity is challenging due to variations in body type. All agreed that age, race, ethnicity, and puberty stage should be considered when defining thresholds of obesity. This input from experts informed the systematic review protocol for an assessment of the DTA of BMI to support the World Health Organization's guideline development for the integrated management of children and adolescents with obesity in all their diversity.",2025,[],[]
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: an emerging comorbidity in COPD.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are highly prevalent conditions that frequently coexist. MASLD, now the leading cause of chronic liver disease globally, affects up to 25% of the population and is increasingly recognized in COPD patients. Shared cardiometabolic risk factors, chronic inflammation, and lipid-mediated injury underpin their pathophysiological link. This review outlines the epidemiology, shared mechanisms, and clinical impact of MASLD in COPD, as well as diagnostic strategies and current management approaches. Recognizing MASLD as a clinically significant comorbidity in COPD may offer new opportunities for risk stratification, integrated care, and targeted therapeutic interventions, underscoring the need for further research into their mechanistic interplay and bidirectional impact.",2025,[],[]
Targeting negative phosphorylation to activate AMPK.,"AMPK is a master regulator of metabolism and is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed. Activation of AMPK stimulates the catabolic pathway (glucose utilization and β-oxidation) and inhibits the anabolic pathway (gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, and lipogenesis), leading to improvement of cellular energy status. However, the mechanisms of maintaining low cellular AMPK activity are not fully understood. We and other investigators showed that activated PKA in the glucagon-cAMP signaling pathway and insulin-activated AKT both can directly phosphorylate AMPKα1/2 at S496/491 to inhibit AMPK activity. In the current study, we found that activation of AMPK by an activator, AICAR, led to elevated and prolonged phosphorylation of AMPKα1/2 at S496/S491, reflecting a feedback inhibition of AMPK activity. In an in vitro assay, functional AMPKα1β1γ1 or AMPKα2β1γ1 can phosphorylate AMPKα1 at S496 or AMPKα2 at S491, respectively. We designed and successfully screened a new AMPKα2-targeting peptide to activate AMPK through competitively blocking the negative phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of gluconeogenic gene expression and promotion of mitochondrial fission in hepatocytes.",2025,"['ampk', 'ampk', 'cellular ampk', 'pka', 'glucagon', 'insulin', 'akt', 'ampkα1 / 2', 'ampk', 'ampk', 'aicar', 'ampkα1 / 2', 'ampk', 'ampkα1β1γ1', 'ampkα2β1γ1', 'ampkα1', 'ampkα2', 'ampkα2 - targeting peptide', 'ampk']","['ampk', 'pka', 'glucagon', 'insulin', 'akt', 'aicar', 'ampkα1', 'ampkα2']"
Cardioprotection Reloaded: Reflections on 40 Years of Research.,"Over the past four decades, cardioprotective research has revealed an extraordinary complexity of cellular and molecular mechanisms capable of mitigating ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Among these, ischemic conditioning has emerged as one of the most influential discoveries: brief episodes of ischemia followed by reperfusion activate protective programs that reduce myocardial damage. These effects can be elicited locally (pre- or postconditioning) or remotely (remote conditioning), acting mainly through paracrine signaling and mitochondria-linked kinase pathways, with both early and delayed windows of protection. We have contributed to clarifying the roles of mitochondria, oxidative stress, prosurvival kinases, connexins, extracellular vesicles, and sterile inflammation, particularly via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Despite robust preclinical evidence, clinical translation of these approaches has remained disappointing. The challenges largely stem from experimental models that poorly reflect real-world clinical settings-such as advanced age, comorbidities, and multidrug therapy-as well as the reliance on surrogate endpoints that do not reliably predict clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, interest in multi-target protective strategies remains strong. New lines of investigation are focusing on emerging mediators-such as gasotransmitters, extracellular vesicles, and endogenous peptides-as well as targeted modulation of inflammatory responses. Future perspectives point toward personalized cardioprotection tailored to patient metabolic and immune profiles, with special attention to high-risk populations in whom IRI continues to represent a major clinical challenge.",2025,"['connexins', 'nlrp3 inflam', '##ome']",['connexins']
Exploring the link between muscle quality and erectile dysfunction: assessing the impact of mass and strength.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Sexual dysfunction is a prevalent issue affecting quality of life. Skeletal muscle mass and strength are emerging biomarkers for overall health. Considered in tandem, sexual function and muscle mass have significant implications for well-being.<h4>Objectives</h4>We aim to explore the relationship between skeletal muscle parameters and sexual function via mechanisms and discuss the role of testosterone.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed literature searches were conducted using MeSH: ""Muscle, Skeletal,"" ""Sexual Dysfunctions, Physiological,"" and ""Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological."" Keywords included ""sarcopenia,"" ""muscle mass,"" ""muscle strength,"" ""hand strength,"" ""resistance training,"" ""skeletal muscle,"" ""weight lifting,"" ""sexual function,"" ""sexual dysfunction,"" ""erectile function,"" ""erectile dysfunction,"" and ""male sexual function.""<h4>Results</h4>This yielded 355 results and 32 were included. Skeletal muscle mass and strength contribute independently to healthy sexual function through metabolic and endothelial mechanisms, particularly in aging adults and men with comorbidities like sarcopenia, diabetes, and obesity. Cross-sectional studies using muscle volume, hand-grip strength (HGS), and bioelectrical impedance assessment show correlations between muscle parameters and erectile function, sexual desire, and overall sexual satisfaction. In older men, HGS correlates with decreased erectile dysfunction risk (OR: 0.86 per 5 kg, 95% CI 0.78-0.96). Despite the established influence of testosterone on muscle and endothelial health, an independent correlation between HGS and International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score persists after adjustment for serum testosterone (β = .169, P = .037) showing the strength of this relationship independent of testosterone.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is a positive correlation between erectile function and muscle health. Maintaining skeletal muscle with nutrition and physical activity improves erectile and overall health outcomes. Therapies that target sexual function and muscle health simultaneously (eg, testosterone and L-carnitine) may further benefit sexual function. Future studies are warranted to strengthen and elucidate this relationship and to follow the longitudinal outcomes of these therapies on sexual health.",2025,[],[]
Raising the Topic: Clinical Needs Assessment and Co-Design of Targeted Clinical Resources for Primary Healthcare Practitioners to Prevent and Manage Childhood Obesity.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study aimed to (a) determine the unmet clinical resource needs of multidisciplinary primary healthcare practitioners (PHPs) to overcome evidence-based barriers to preventing and managing childhood obesity in practice; and (b) co-design precision solutions to the identified needs of PHPs.<h4>Methods</h4>This qualitative study was conducted across three phases: (1) clinical needs assessment with 18 multidisciplinary PHPs over five virtual focus groups, (2) participatory, user-centred co-design via an online design workshop with five PHPs and four caregivers, and (3) clinical resource prototype development and qualitative user feedback. Data was thematically analysed using the Framework Method.<h4>Results</h4>Clinical needs assessment (phase 1) identified unmet resource needs across four themes: (a) visual and simple clinically integrated media; (b) positive, health-focused language and countering shame; (c) referral opportunities and clinical upskilling in priority areas; (d) practical family-based, culturally appropriate and early years focus. Co-design (phase 2) developed nine clinical resource solutions. A prototype was developed for clinical piloting that targets the pervasive barrier of initiating a conversation about weight and healthy growth-the BRAVE (Build relationships, Raise respectfully, Ask about attitudes, Validate values, Engage & enable) framework. The purpose of BRAVE is to improve PHP self-efficacy to raise the topic of weight and to provide a safe, trusted and empowering environment for children and families.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study uncovered unmet clinical resource needs for PHPs to confidently address childhood obesity and co-designed a new clinical resource to help PHPs raise the topic of weight with families that is ready for clinical piloting.",2025,[],[]
"Case Report: Efficacy and safety of dose-escalated Mazdutide, a GLP-1/GCGR dual agonist, in an adolescent with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperuricemia.","<h4>Objective</h4>Mazdutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon receptor (GLP - 1/GCGR) dual agonist, has shown marked efficacy in glycemic control, weight loss, and metabolic improvement in adults. However, data in adolescents remain limited. This report explores its therapeutic potential in an adolescent with obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperuricemia (HUA).<h4>Study design and methods</h4>We report the case of a 15-year-old male patient diagnosed with obesity (BMI: 30.64 kg/m²), type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c: 9.60%), and hyperuricemia (serum uric acid: 511 μmol/L). The patient underwent a dose-escalation regimen of Mazdutide (2 mg → 4 mg → 6 mg, administered subcutaneously once weekly) in combination with metformin and insulin to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and safety outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>After 36 weeks, the patient showed significant improvement: weight decreased by 16.8 kg (18.89% BMI reduction), uric acid dropped by 37.00%, and HbA1c fell by 21.88%. No hypoglycemic episodes occurred. Lipid levels improved notably: triglycerides fell by 69.02%, total cholesterol by 13.65%, and LDL cholesterol by 17.27%. Hepatic steatosis resolved by week 14, as confirmed by ultrasound. No adverse events were reported, and benefits were sustained post-treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Mazdutide exhibited robust metabolic efficacy and good tolerability in an adolescent with obesity, T2DM, and HUA. It improved glycemic control, reduced weight and uric acid, reversed steatosis, and modulated lipid profiles. These findings support its potential as a comprehensive treatment for adolescent metabolic disorders.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1', 'glucagon receptor', 'g', '##lp - 1', 'gcgr', 'insulin', 'h', '##1', 'ldl cholester']","['glucagon like peptide 1', 'glucagon receptor', 'gcgr', 'insulin']"

PAK4 phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 2 to promote the G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S transition during adipogenesis.,"p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), a member of the PAK family (PAK1-6), was initially recognized for its role in tumor development. Recently, we discovered PAK4's involvement in triacylglycerol lipolysis in adipocytes. However, its function in adipogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that PAK4 plays a critical role in adipocyte differentiation. Following adipogenic stimulation, PAK4 protein levels increased. Knockdown of PAK4 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or human stromal vascular cells, as well as pharmacological inhibition of PAK4 in 3T3-L1 cells, impaired adipogenesis, as indicated by reduced expression of adipocyte marker genes and decreased lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, PAK4 phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 at serine 106, a critical step for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β expression during mitotic clonal expansion. Consistent with these findings, preadipocyte-specific Pak4-knockout mice exhibited reduced fat mass and smaller adipocytes. These results reveal PAK4 as a crucial regulator of adipogenesis and, together with its inhibitory role in triacylglycerol lipolysis, further underscore its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity treatment.",2025,"['p21 - activated kinase 4', 'pak4', 'pak family', 'pak1 - 6', 'pak4', 'pak4', 'pak4 protein', 'pak4', 'pak4', 'pak4', 'c', '##yclin - dependent kinase 2', 'ccaat / enhancer - binding protein β', 'pak4', 'pak4']",['pak4']
MOB1 deletion in murine mature adipocytes ameliorates obesity and diabetes.,"There is currently a global epidemic of obesity and obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes due to decreased physical activity, excessive food intake, and/or genetic predisposition. The Hippo-YAP1 pathway has attracted attention as a potential therapeutic target because YAP1/TAZ activation in murine immature adipocytes in vitro suppresses their differentiation by inhibiting PPARγ activity. However, the role of YAP1 activation in mature adipocytes in vivo remains unclear. MOB1, whose expression is increased in obesity, is the hub of the Hippo core molecule complex and negatively regulates YAP1/TAZ activation. Therefore, we generated aMob1DKO mutant mice, which feature deficiency of <i>Mob1a/b</i> specifically in mature adipocytes. Compared to controls, aMob1DKO mice subjected to a high-fat diet showed beneficial changes consistent with resistance to diet-induced obesity. The mutants exhibited increases in basal lipolysis, ""beiging,"" and energy expenditure, as well as suppression of ROS production and inflammation in white adipose tissue. Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved, and ectopic fat accumulation was reduced. Most of these changes were dependent on the YAP1 activation observed in mature white adipose tissue of aMob1DKO mice. FGF21, which improves lipid metabolism, was upregulated directly via YAP1 activation, and many of the phenotypes seen in aMob1DKO mice were also dependent on FGF21. Thus, the aMob1DKO mouse is an interesting model for the study of the metabolic effects of diet-induced obesity and protection against diabetes. Our work suggests that a YAP1-FGF21 axis exists in adipocytes that may be a potential therapeutic target for obesity.",2025,"['hippo', 'yap1', 'yap1', 'taz', 'pparγ', 'yap1', 'mob1', 'hippo core molecule complex', 'yap1', 'taz', 'amob1dko mutant', 'mob1a / b', 'amob1dko', 'insulin', 'yap1', 'amob1dko', 'fgf21', 'yap1', 'amob1dko', 'fgf21', 'amob1dko', 'yap1', 'fgf21']","['yap1', 'taz', 'pparγ', 'mob1', 'insulin', 'fgf21']"
Effects of Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy on Fat Mass and Glucose Homeostasis in Humans and Animals: A Narrative Review with Systematic Literature Search.,"Overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are metabolic health problems and diseases that affect billions of people worldwide. Studies in animals and humans suggest that stimulating global muscle hypertrophy could be a treatment for these diseases, as some key studies suggest that stimulation of global muscle hypertrophy commonly reduces fat mass and improves glucose homeostasis. To analyse the effect of muscle hypertrophy on fat and glucose homeostasis in more detail, we systematically searched the literature and quantitatively analyzed 122 studies (humans: n = 99; animals: n = 23). This analysis reveals that a 1.9-3.3% increase in global muscle mass in humans is associated with 4.1 ± 5.8% lower fat mass, a mean relative reduction in HbA1c of 4.1 ± 4.6% from baseline, and a reduction of fasting glucose concentrations by 5.8 ± 7.3% in studies lasting 2 weeks to 3 years. In the animal studies analyzed, the researchers increased muscle mass by transgenesis, drugs, or resistance training by 17.7 ± 18.4%. This increase of muscle mass was associated with 23.7 ± 22.3% less fat mass. In the second part of this review, we discuss mechanisms by which muscle hypertrophy can affect fat mass and glucose homeostasis. We also discuss the potential use of hypertrophy-focused resistance training and muscle hypertrophy-stimulating drugs as treatments for people with overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.",2025,['h'],[]
Murine Models of Obesity-Related Cancer Risk.,"Obesity is a global menace that has impacted more than 14% of adults worldwide and more than a third of Americans. Importantly, obesity is associated with an increased risk of more than 13 types of cancer and worse outcomes, including increased mortality. This review focuses on the importance of considering obesity and metabolic dysfunction in cancer risk as part of the NCI's funded consortium known as the Metabolic Dysfunction and Cancer Risk Program. It describes previous and ongoing mouse models used in studies conducted by Metabolic Dysfunction and Cancer Risk Program consortium members, as well as other relevant studies. Most cancer studies examine tumor progression, metastasis, or recurrence, which are consequences following tumor onset; however, this approach does not consider risk per se. To truly model cancer risk, parameters to measure include the quantification of cancer onset, measured as incidence or latency. Investigators must be cognizant of many factors in study design, including the choice of cancer model and genetic strain. Preclinical approaches addressing risk typically include genetically engineered mouse models or the administration of irritants or carcinogens. We also discuss the transplantation of cells or tumors such as allografts or xenografts, with a focus on tumor rejection or regression to approximate cancer risk, not cancer progression. Herein, we highlight two cancers, breast and colorectal cancers, in which risk is associated with obesity and discussed varied murine model approaches, as well as key findings that explore cancer risk, prevention, or interception.",2025,[],[]
Rates of Acute Kidney Injury Utilizing Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve Versus Trough-Based Vancomycin Dosing Strategies in Patients With Obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Vancomycin is commonly utilized for the treatment of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infections. Dosing recommendations for vancomycin have shifted in recent years to favor area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) instead of trough-based dosing strategies to decrease vancomycin exposure and rates of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, little data exist on the safety and efficacy of AUC-based dosing in patients with obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2022. Adult patients aged ≥18 years were included if they were obese and received vancomycin for treatment of a severe MRSA infection for at least 72 hours. The primary outcome was incidence of AKI based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.<h4>Results</h4>After initial screening, 398 patients were included, with 230 in the trough group and 168 in the AUC group. Rates of AKI were lower in the AUC group compared to the trough group (11.3% vs 25.2%, <i>P</i> < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, logistic regression maintained a reduction in AKI with AUC-based dosing for cumulative doses less than the median of 10 250 mg (odds ratio, 0.47 [95% confidence interval, .25-.88]) but not for doses above. Rates of initial target attainment were also higher with AUC-based dosing (50.0% vs 23.9%, <i>P</i> < .001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with obesity receiving vancomycin for treatment of severe MRSA infections experienced lower rates of AKI when utilizing an AUC- versus trough-based dosing strategy.",2025,[],[]
Proteomic Insights into Childhood Obesity: A Systematic Review of Protein Biomarkers and Advances.,"Childhood obesity has emerged as one of the most pressing public health challenges of the 21st century. Early-onset obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing numerous comorbidities later in life. Despite extensive research into its multifactorial etiology-including genetic, behavioral, environmental, and socioeconomic factors-the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the development and persistence of obesity in the pediatric population remain incompletely understood. Proteomics offers promising insights into these mechanisms. The application of proteomics in pediatric obesity research has grown, enabling the identification of proteins that reflect dynamic changes in metabolic and inflammatory pathways. This advancement allows clinicians to move beyond traditional anthropometric measurements toward personalized approaches with notification of early complications of obesity. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2010 and 2025. Inclusion criteria: human studies, participants aged 0-18, proteomic analysis of obesity, and biomarkers. Data extraction and quality assessment followed standardized protocols. From 239 articles, 20 were included. Key dysregulated proteins include APOA1, CLU, and HP. LC-MS/MS was the predominant technique used. Some biomarkers were predictive for obesity complications in children. Proteomics holds clinical potential for early detection and personalized treatment of pediatric obesity. Standardized methodologies and longitudinal studies are needed for translation into clinical practice.",2025,"['apoa1', 'clu']","['apoa1', 'clu']"
World Health Organization Evidence-Based Self-Help Plus Intervention for Stress Management via Chatbot: Protocol for Adaptation to a Tech-Enabled Model.,"<h4>Background</h4>This paper describes the adaptation of an evidence-based intervention for mental health, Self-Help Plus (SH+), to a digital platform, aiming to expand mental health support through innovative technological solutions. The SH+ intervention, designed by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a low-intensity, self-guided program aimed at improving mental well-being. The intervention has been integrated into a chatbot-driven mobile app called ""ALBA"" (Automated Well-Being Assistant).<h4>Objective</h4>This protocol describes the stages of transition (porting) from a traditional face-to-face, group-based approach to a tech-enabled model, tailored specifically for women with breast cancer and pregnant women. The adaptation of this approach is described, focusing on 2 key aspects: (1) the shift from in-person delivery to a tech-enabled intervention and (2) the customization of the intervention to address the unique needs of the selected target groups.<h4>Methods</h4>The development of the ALBA app involved a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach combining expertise in psychology, eHealth IT, interaction design, and specific domain knowledge related to pregnancy and oncology. The development process followed 2 primary methodologies: user-centered design and service design. These approaches emphasize understanding user needs, promoting iterative improvements, and continuously incorporating user feedback. The development followed the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model, which involves a cycle of literature review, stakeholder consultation, content development, software development, and evaluation. At the same time, specific attention was dedicated to (1) adapting the SH+ protocol to suit the chatbot-driven ALBA platform, (2) tailoring content to the target population, and (3) incorporating interactive features to improve engagement and potential efficacy.<h4>Results</h4>The manuscript outlines the key steps and processes involved in adapting the SH+ intervention into the ALBA digital platform. This includes an overview of the challenges and opportunities of translating a face-to-face, group-based intervention into a tech-enabled model and provides insight into how customization for specific populations, such as women with breast cancer and pregnant women, was integrated into the design of the platform. This is in view of informing future studies on the development and adaptation of already validated protocols into mobile health (mHealth) interventions in the field of mental health and mental well-being.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The digital adaptation of the SH+ intervention into the ALBA platform could represent a significant step forward in expanding the accessibility and personalization of mental health interventions in potentially different settings and target groups. The use of virtual coaching applications can play a central role in improving the availability and ease of access of psychological support, even in different and mHealth formats. Future developments could include further testing in real-world settings to expand (1) adaptations for various target groups and (2) the purpose of use to range from primary prevention to more clinically focused interventions.<h4>International registered report identifier (irrid)</h4>DERR1-10.2196/69644.",2025,[],[]
Protein O-GlcNAcylation in reproductive biology and the impact of metabolic disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible post-translational modification which regulates the function of thousands of proteins to control generic and cell type-specific actions. O-GlcNAc addition and removal downstream of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is mediated by only two enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively. Crucially, O-GlcNAcylation provides a regulatory layer to protein function that is responsive to metabolic status and thus metabolic disease impinges on this system. Animal and ex vivo models show that O-GlcNAcylation is important for peri-conceptual and pregnancy processes.<h4>Objective and rationale</h4>Fundamental knowledge about O-GlcNAcylation of proteins involved in reproductive processes is lacking. Here, we give relevant, and mechanistically well understood, examples of how protein O-GlcNAcylation can affect cellular processes and examine available data on germ cells, embryonic development, endometrial receptivity, and placentation. OGT and OGA regulation are placed within the wider context of reproductive biology. We also highlight gaps in knowledge and suggest avenues for next-phase research.<h4>Search methods</h4>PubMed and Google Scholar (2013-2024) were interrogated, including only publications in English. Search terms included: GlcNAc AND Oocyte, GlcNAc AND Sperm, GlcNAc AND Embryo, GlcNAc AND Cell Differentiation, GlcNAc AND Endometrium, GlcNAc AND Endometrial Receptivity, GlcNAc AND Placenta, GlcNAc AND diabetes, and GlcNAc AND obesity.<h4>Outcomes</h4>Some evidence for the global impact of O-GlcNAcylation in maturation of oocytes and sperm, pre-implantation development, implantation, and placentation has been gathered by pharmacological inhibition and/or targeted mutagenesis of OGT and OGA. Blocking or inactivating OGT gives an embryonic lethal phenotype in most species. Mouse embryos can tolerate inactivation of OGA, but the offspring are growth-restricted and die postnatally. In general, HBP utilization in pre-implantation differs between species. This is likely to be the case in post-implantation development too, but it is already clear from stem cell biology that O-GlcNAcylation is important in the differentiation of most embryonic cell lineages including neurones, osteoclasts, enterocytes, and adipocytes. The identification of the progesterone receptor as an OGT target suggests important and widespread involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in reproductive processes. In the adult endometrium, protein O-GlcNAcylation decreases during decidualization, however, there is some evidence to suggest that O-GlcNAcylation of specific proteins promotes receptivity to the implanting embryo. In placenta, key aspects of development (e.g. angiogenesis) and function (e.g. transport, hormone production) are influenced by O-GlcNAcylation. Hyperglycaemia-induced changes in protein O-GlcNAcylation have negative impacts throughout reproductive systems and while there is less information on the consequences of lipid-mediated alterations to this post-translational modification, available evidence points to skewed protein O-GlcNAcylation contributing to impaired reproductive function in individuals living with obesity.<h4>Wider implications</h4>This review highlights protein O-GlcNAcylation as a regulator of reproductive processes and identifies large knowledge gaps which must be filled to improve fundamental understanding. Targeting O-GlcNAcylation regulatory networks, including acceptor site mutagenesis, in defined cell populations of reproductive tissues will advance knowledge. The interface of O-GlcNAcylation with metabolic disease needs disentangling to determine how interventions to alleviate disease impact reproductive outcomes.<h4>Registration number</h4>N/A.",2025,"['o - glcnac transferase', 'ogt', 'o - glcnacase', 'oga', 'ogt', 'oga', '##nac', 'g', '##nac', 'ogt', 'oga', 'ogt', 'oga', 'h', 'progesterone receptor', 'ogt']","['ogt', 'oga', 'progesterone receptor']"
miR-6402 targets &lt;i&gt;Bmpr2&lt;/i&gt; and negatively regulates mouse adipogenesis.,"Obesity is characterized by macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. White adipose tissue remodelling under inflammatory conditions involves both hypertrophy and adipogenesis and is regulated by transcription factors, which are influenced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and are involved in obesity-related processes such as adipogenesis. Therefore, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs in the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of mice fed a normal diet (ND) and those fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The expression of miR-6402 was significantly suppressed in the inflamed eWAT of HFD-fed mice than in ND-fed mice. Furthermore, <i>Bmpr2</i>, the receptor for BMP4, was identified as a target gene of miR-6402. Consistently, miR-6402 was downregulated in the inflamed eWAT of HFD-fed mice and in 3T3-L1 cells (preadipocytes) and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (mature adipocytes) , and BMPR2 expression in these cells was upregulated. Adipogenesis was induced in WAT by BMP4 injection (<i>in vivo</i>) and in 3T3-L1 cells by BMP4 stimulation (<i>in vitro</i>), both of which were inhibited by miR-6402 transfection. Inflamed eWAT showed higher expression of BMPR2 and the adipogenesis markers C/EBPβ and PPARγ, which was suppressed by miR-6402 transfection. Our findings suggest that miR-6402 is a novel anti-adipogenic miRNA that combats obesity by inhibiting the BMP4/BMPR2 signalling pathway and subsequently reducing adipose tissue expansion.",2025,"['bone morphogenetic protein', 'bmp', 'mir - 6402', 'bmpr2', 'bmp4', 'mir - 6402', 'mir - 6402', 'bmpr2', 'bmp4', 'bmp4', 'mir - 6402', 'bmpr2', 'c / ebpβ', 'pparγ', 'mir - 6402', 'mir - 6402', 'bmp4', 'bmpr2']","['bone morphogenetic protein', 'bmp', 'bmpr2', 'bmp4', 'pparγ']"
Correlation between different types of obesity and hypertension in perimenopausal working women.,"Hypertension (HTN) can lead to a series of target organ damage and is associated with increased cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. Perimenopause implies an important physiological transition. Previous studies have confirmed that obesity is a risk factor for the development of HTN. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the prevalence of HTN in perimenopausal women and the relationships between peripheral or abdominal obesity and HTN. Therefore, we analysed the influencing factors of HTN in perimenopausal working women and the correlation between different types of obesity and HTN to provide evidence for the need to prevent HTN in perimenopausal women. Perimenopausal women who underwent physical examination at Shanghai Health and Medical Center from January 2021 to October 2021 were selected as subjects. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyse the associations between different types of obesity and HTN in perimenopausal women. Five hundred eighty-two perimenopausal women were included in this study; 124 cases of HTN were detected (incidence rate 21.31%), 23 of which were isolated systolic HTN (18.55% of total HTN cases). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age and BMI were the influencing factors of HTN in perimenopausal women. Compared with that of perimenopausal women without peripheral obesity, HTN in overweight (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.13-2.98) and peripheral obesity (OR = 4.36, 95% CI: 1.52-12.54) women increased with increasing body weight. Perimenopausal women with abdominal obesity had a greater risk of developing HTN (OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.16-6.21) (P < 0.05). Age and BMI are risk factors for the development of HTN in perimenopausal working women. Both abdominal obesity and peripheral obesity are positively associated with HTN in perimenopausal women. The BMI and abdominal circumference of perimenopausal women need to be monitored as early as possible to prevent obesity and reduce the occurrence of HTN.",2025,['h'],[]
Getting back on track: Development of a blended-care intervention for weight recurrence after metabolic bariatric surgery using intervention mapping.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To systematically re-develop a blended-care intervention addressing weight recurrence after metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). Weight recurrence poses a significant longterm challenge for around 20-30 % of MBS patients. The intervention aims to improve weight outcomes and enhance patient well-being. This study describes the novel application of the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol, integrating scientific evidence and stakeholder input.<h4>Methods</h4>The six-step IM protocol guided the development process, ensuring the active involvement of patients and healthcare professionals. A comprehensive needs assessment using quantitative, qualitative, and literature-based approaches informed the creation of a logic model of the problem (Step 1) and a logic model of change (Step 2). Program outcomes and objectives were formulated through collaborative brainstorming and design-thinking sessions, leading to intervention design (Step 3). The intervention was co-produced with patients, implementers, and an app developer (Step 4). Detailed implementation (Step 5) and evaluation (Step 6) plans were subsequently developed.<h4>Results</h4>The IM process yielded a blended-care intervention grounded in theoretical frameworks and evidence-based methods. The intervention actively involved the target population and implementers, addressing key determinants of weight recurrence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The IM protocol demonstrated utility in designing a tailored, theory-based intervention post-MBS. The process emphasized the value of integrating stakeholder perspectives and highlighted the feasibility of co-creating an evidence-informed intervention.<h4>Innovation</h4>This intervention incorporates newly developed elements in a novel blended-care structure. Future evaluation is necessary to determine its effectiveness in achieving the desired outcomes.",2025,[],[]
What (not) to eat: Exploring weight-loss and dietary intentions in representative samples from Germany and Austria.,"Despite significant health risks associated with high body weight and poor diet, little is known about the prevalence and targets of weight-loss and dietary intentions. This information could, however, help tailor behaviour change interventions. Therefore, the present study described weight-loss and dietary intentions and their co-occurrence in a representative sample (N = 1,510; 50.40% women; M<sub>age</sub> = 48.55, SD<sub>age</sub> = 16.68; M<sub>BMI</sub> = 26.89, SD<sub>BMI</sub> = 5.92) from Germany (n = 1,006) and Austria (n = 504). Weight-loss (57%) and dietary avoidance intentions (i.e., intention to eat less of certain foods; 59%) were more prevalent than dietary approach intentions (i.e., intention to eat more of certain foods; 34%). A discrepancy between weight-loss intention and indication (i.e., meeting BMI criteria for weight-loss recommendation: BMI ≥ 25) was found for 27% of individuals. Most common target foods were 'snacks high in sugar, fat, and/or salt' (24%), 'meat' (12%) and 'sugar/foods high in sugar' (11%) for avoidance and 'fruits and vegetables' (27%) and 'protein/foods high in protein' (3%) for approach intentions. These findings indicate that individuals might benefit from enhanced awareness of body weight recommendations and a less avoidance-centered perspective on eating, as approach strategies might be more effective in changing behaviour.",2025,[],[]
Safflower injection against obesity-induced mice podocyte injury by improving insulin resistance through increasing renal INSR and eNOS expression.,"<h4>Background</h4>Podocyte injury is a common pathologic mechanism in obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG). Safflower injection (SFI), scientifically extracted and refined from safflower, is used to treat diabetic kidney disease according to clinical guideline. Our previous study confirmed that the main active compounds of SFI ameliorated high glucose-induced podocyte injury. It is uncertain whether SFI has an effect on ORG-related podocyte injury.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to explore the pharmacological effects and related mechanisms of SFI on podocyte injury of ORG mice.<h4>Methods</h4>First, by combining ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis with online databases, the pathway enrichment, target-pathway analysis, and human protein-protein interaction network were conducted to discover the possible crucial mechanism of SFI against ORG. Then, ORG mice model was established by high-fat diet and biochemical assays, histopathology and western blot were used to explore the effects of SFI on obesity and podocyte injury. Finally, system pharmacology-based findings were evaluated in ORG mice.<h4>Results</h4>The results of system pharmacology suggested that SFI could alleviate ORG through insulin resistance (IR)-related pathway by regulating insulin receptor (INSR) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expressions. The <i>in vivo</i> experiment confirmed that SFI ameliorated obesity, lipid metabolism-related indicators, podocyte injury of ORG mice. The mechanism relationships among IR, INSR, and eNOS were further verified in ORG mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings imply that by up-regulating the expression of renal INSR and eNOS, thereby inhibiting IR, SFI may be a promising candidate for the treatment of ORG.",2025,"['s', 's', 'insulin', 'insulin receptor', 'insr', 'endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'enos', 's', 'ir', 'insr', 'enos', 're', 'insr', 'enos', 'sfi']","['insulin', 'insulin receptor', 'insr', 'endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'enos']"
Differential Effects of Visceral and Subcutaneous Adiposity on Peripheral Neuropathy.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Obesity increases the risk of diabetic neuropathy. This study investigates the impact of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volume on peripheral neuropathy.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 302 adults from the Qatar Biobank (QBB) underwent iDXA to measure VAT and SAT volumes, intima media thickness (IMT), and peripheral neuropathy assessments using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM), vibration perception threshold (VPT), and the DN4 questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>The QBB cohort was aged 43.9 ± 12.9 years, of whom 43.7% were women, 42.1% had obesity, 17.4% had type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 10.9% had hypertension. VAT was associated with T2D, hypertension, higher HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and inflammatory markers, and lower HDL (p < 0.0001). There were no significant associations between SAT and these cardiovascular risk factors. VAT volume was associated with lower corneal nerve inferior whorl length (IWL) (p < 0.05) and higher VPT (p = 0.01), partially mediated by elevated HbA1c (p < 0.05, p = 0.001) and IMT (p < 0.0001), while its association with neuropathic symptoms was fully mediated by systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), T2D (p < 0.01), and triglycerides (p = 0.05). SAT showed no associations with measures of neuropathy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VAT but not SAT is associated with peripheral neuropathy. This study underscores the need to target VAT to improve neuropathy.",2025,"['h', 'hdl', 'h']",['hdl']
Analysis of risk factors for bleeding after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection with an emphasis on age and sex differences: A nationwide population-based study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been increasingly performed in elderly patients. However, bleeding remains a major complication. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the risk factors of post-procedural bleeding, focusing on age and sex differences.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a nationwide, population-based, retrospective study utilizing the Korean NHIS database, comprising patients who underwent gastric ESD from November 2011 to December 2022. Operational definitions were created to identify the target population and post-procedural bleeding within 30 days. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for bleeding. The variables comprehensively included basic demographic factors, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, medication usage, and lifestyle behaviors.<h4>Results</h4>7825 bleeding events occurred in 164,968 procedures. In multiple logistic regression, significant risk factors included young age, male sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), gastric cancer, multiple lesions, several comorbidities (highest aOR for renal failure undergoing hemodialysis) and antithrombotic agents (highest aOR for warfarin), underweight, current smoking, and heavy drinking. Being overweight and obese, however, showed a protective effect. Certain variables impacted bleeding risk differently based on age and sex. In the elderly group, high CCI and DOAC use were more influential, while male sex, smoking, and drinking had a diminished effect. Sex differences were more pronounced in the non-elderly group, with gastric cancer, warfarin use, and heavy drinking having a greater impact, while SES and obesity offered stronger protection in females.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified risk factors for post-ESD bleeding and highlighted the role of age and sex in risk stratification and personalized treatment.",2025,[],[]
Approach to the Patient: Low Testosterone Concentrations in Men With Obesity.,"Pathologic hypogonadism occurs when serum testosterone is significantly and persistently reduced by irreversible organic (structural, genetic) disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary testicular axis. Men with pathologic hypogonadism require lifelong testosterone replacement. In contrast, mild or moderate reductions in serum testosterone frequently accompany obesity, and its numerous comorbidities in men are best considered nongonadal illness syndromes, wherein reduction in serum testosterone is usually reversible upon amelioration of the underlying nongonadal illness. Obesity can result in nonspecific symptoms in conjunction with reduced serum testosterone and serum SHBG. Obesity-related reductions in SHBG, testosterone's principal circulating carrier protein, are primarily responsible for measured reductions in testosterone. However, obesity is not a cause of pathological hypogonadism, and proportionately reduced testosterone and SHBG concentrations accompanied by normal serum LH and FSH concentrations confirm a eugonadal state, best described as the pseudo-hypogonadism of obesity. Herein we demonstrate how clinically significant weight loss substantially reverses obesity-related reductions in serum testosterone and ameliorates nonspecific symptoms resembling, but not due to, androgen deficiency. The important reversible steps include weight reduction and optimizing management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and other obesity-related comorbidities as well as rationalizing concomitant drug regimens. In the absence of pathological hypogonadism, testosterone treatment is less effective than a diet and lifestyle intervention to rectify the reversible conditions responsible for the nonspecific symptoms and associated reduced serum testosterone concentrations observed in men with obesity. As such, testosterone treatment is not indicated, and unwarranted off-label testosterone treatment can lead to adverse effects such as infertility, elevated hematocrit requiring venesection, a prothrombotic state, and testosterone dependence.",2025,"['serum shbg', 'shbg', 'shbg', 'serum lh', 'fsh']","['shbg', 'fsh']"
The NLRP3 inhibitor NT-0796 enhances and sustains GLP-1R agonist-mediated weight loss in a murine diet-induced obesity model.,"<h4>Objective</h4>In order to investigate whether a central nervous system penetrant anti-inflammatory could augment or sustain obesity treatment with semaglutide (Wegovy), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, we tested two hypotheses in models of diet-induced obesity (DIO): 1) a centrally penetrant NLPR3 inhibitor, NT-0796, drives enhanced weight loss when combined with low-dose semaglutide, compared to monotherapy; and 2) NT-0796 monotherapy sustains weight loss induced by semaglutide.<h4>Methods</h4>Mice fed a standard high-fat or a polyunsaturated fatty acid diet served as models of DIO and were dosed with low-dose semaglutide, NT-0796, or combinations. Body weight, food intake, peripheral inflammatory markers, and hypothalamic glial fibrillary acidic protein expression were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Combined dosing of NT-0796 with semaglutide drove greater weight loss than either monotherapy alone, and this effect was enhanced in mice consuming the polyunsaturated fatty acid diet. In addition, NT-0796 sharply limited weight regain following cessation of semaglutide therapy and normalized markers of both peripheral inflammation and hypothalamic astrogliosis to a far greater extent than either semaglutide or calorie restriction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Alleviation of obesity-associated inflammation via NLRP3 inhibition 1) constitutes an effective weight-loss strategy as monotherapy in mice with DIO, 2) augments the weight-loss efficacy of a subtherapeutic dose of semaglutide, and 3) blocks recovery of lost weight following cessation of semaglutide.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'g', '##lp - 1r', 'nlpr3', 'hypothalamic glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'nlrp3']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'nlrp3']"
"Autoimmunity in MASLD: Focus on autoantibodies, anti-apolipoprotein A1 IgG and G protein-coupled receptors.","<h4>Background</h4>The increasing prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), represents a significant public health concern, as it is closely linked to rising obesity rates and metabolic syndrome, affecting approximately 30% of the global population. In addition, MASLD, along with its more severe form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), increases the risk of cardio-metabolic diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, multiple G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for these disorders. Additionally, autoimmunity is believed to potentially play a role in the development of mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of MASLD/MASH. This narrative review examines the diverse autoantibodies associated with the disease, with a particular emphasis on antibodies targeting apolipoprotein A-1 (AAA-1) and their relationship with anti-GPCRs antibodies.<h4>Results</h4>Several autoantibodies have been identified in up to 30% of individuals with MASLD/MASH, both with and without concomitant autoimmune diseases. Among the anti-GPCR autoantibodies identified in MASLD to date are those targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and the endothelin-1 type A receptor. While the contribution of this class of autoantibodies to MASLD/NASH remains unclear, AAA-1 appears to be pathogenic, acting as pro-steatotic and pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, current data suggest shared functional responses between anti-GPCR antibodies and AAA1 in cell-based assays used to detect anti-GPCR presence.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A better understanding of the role of humoral autoimmunity and the interactions among its various components in the metabolic dysfunction underlying MASLD/MASH has the potential to open new perspectives for early detection and therapeutic interventions.",2025,"['g - protein - coupled receptors', 'gpcrs', 'ma', 'apolipoprotein a - 1', 'aaa - 1', 'anti - gpcrs antibodies', 'mash', 'anti - gpcr auto', '##bo', 'angiotensin ii type 1 receptor', 'endothelin - 1 type a receptor', 'na', 'aaa - 1', 'anti - gpcr antibodies', 'aaa1', 'anti - gpcr', 'ma']","['g protein coupled receptors', 'gpcr', 'apolipoprotein a 1', 'mash', 'angiotensin ii type 1 receptor', 'aaa1']"
N-Butyl-2-Cyanoacrylate versus Microspheres on Weight Change and Ghrelin Expressions in Swine Bariatric Embolization Model.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a global health challenge, leading researchers to explore innovative treatments. Bariatric arterial embolization (BAE), which blocks blood flow to parts of the stomach, shows promise for weight management by affecting hunger hormones like ghrelin. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and microspheres in suppressing weight gain and ghrelin expression after BAE in a swine model.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Fifteen healthy juvenile male farm pigs were randomly allocated into three groups: NBCA embolization (n = 5), microsphere embolization (n = 5), and a control group (n = 5). Embolization targeted the right, left, and short gastric arteries. Weight and fasting plasma ghrelin levels were monitored weekly for 16 weeks. Gastric endoscopy was performed 1 and 4 weeks post-BAE, and each animal's ghrelin-expressing cells in the stomach's fundus, body, and antrum were analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>By week 16, the NBCA group showed lower weight gain (58.4 ± 17.8%) compared to that in the microsphere (114.0 ± 0.0%; P < .001) and control groups (123.9 ± 18.1%; P < .001). The NBCA group had lower mean ghrelin-expressing cell densities in the gastric fundus (P < .001), body (P = .002), and antrum (P = 0.003) compared to those in the control group, and lower ghrelin-expressing cell densities in the fundus compared to those in the microsphere group (P < .001). Endoscopy at 1-week post-BAE revealed gastric ulcers in 2 pigs in the NBCA group (40%) and all pigs (100%) in the microsphere group, which healed by week 4; no ulcers were found in the control group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In a swine model of bariatric arterial embolization, NBCA was more effective than microspheres in reducing weight gain and ghrelin expression in the stomach fundus, indicating its potential for managing obesity through BAE.",2025,"['ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'ghrelin', 'ghrelin']",['ghrelin']
Future potential therapeutics to treat MASH.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), poses a significant global health challenge due to its association with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular complications. Despite its rising prevalence, effective therapies remain limited. This review highlights emerging therapeutic strategies that target key pathways involved in MASH pathogenesis, including THR-β, FXR, PPAR, GLP-1RA, FGF21, and SGLT2. In addition, novel approaches such as gene therapy (siRNA), probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and stem cell therapy show promise for the treatment of MASH. Ongoing clinical trials and mechanistic insights into fibrosis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism provide hope for tailored, multi-targeted treatments.

Conducting the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2023 in Malaysia with focus on methodology and main findings on non-communicable diseases.,"The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS), which focuses on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), their risk factors and healthcare demand, is a cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based survey conducted every four-year cycle since 2011. NHMS 2023 was the 7th cycle of NCDs, their risk factors and healthcare demand, which aimed to monitor trends in diseases and healthcare utilisation. This article outlines the methodology, sociodemographic characteristics, and overall findings from the population surveyed in 2023 regarding NCDs, their risk factors, and various health-related topics. This survey utilised a two-stage stratified random sampling design and encompassed fifteen main scopes, with sample sizes calculated to meet the specific requirements of each scope. Conducted from July to September 2023, it involved the random selection of 499 enumeration blocks(EBs) by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) across all states and federal territories in Malaysia. The step resulted in the selection of 5,988 living quarters (LQs). Data collection methods included validated questionnaires administered through face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires, alongside clinical assessments and blood investigations using calibrated devices. To ensure the high quality of the collected data, we implemented stringent quality control measures. Furthermore, we applied complex sampling analyses to ensure that the findings accurately represented the population in Malaysia. The survey received responses from 13,616 individuals out of the 5,006 LQs that were successfully visited, resulting in an overall response rate of the survey of 83.2%, which includes individuals aged 5 years and above. A substantial segment of the population lived in urban regions, comprising 77.6% of the total. About half of the population consisted of males (51.9%), Malay (54.6%), and individuals who had attained secondary education (54.2%). Additionally, 20.0% of the population were within the age range of 30 to 39 years. The weighted prevalence of diabetes was 15.6%, hypertension 29.2%, hypercholesterolaemia 33.3%, overweight and obesity 54.4%. Depression among adults was 4.6%, while mental health problems among children were reported at 16.5%. The current tobacco smokers prevalence was 19.0%, and 29.9% of adults in Malaysia were physically inactive. The known asthma prevalence among adults was 6.2%, while the current asthma among children was 3.4%. Additionally, 37.7% of adults experienced sleep insufficiency. The results indicate that the higher proportion of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia, particularly among the young age group, and the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, as well as mental health problems,  are making the healthcare system deal with more non-communicable diseases, complications, and problems. The methodology of this survey is robust for a population-based study. We took comprehensive steps to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The findings indicate an urgent need for targeted public health interventions to address the escalating health issues. By focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies, we can mitigate the impact of NCDs on the healthcare system and improve overall population health.",2025,[],[]
"Herbal Medicine and Lifestyle Modifications for People with Obesity: A Single-Center, Retrospective, Observational Study.","<b>Objectives</b>: Conventional Western treatments for obesity are associated with various adverse events (AEs). This study aimed to determine the treatment response and safety assessment of an integrative Korean medicine treatment (IKMT), consisting of herbal medicine (HM) and lifestyle modification (LM), for weight loss (WL) in people with obesity. <b>Methods</b>: The electronic medical records of outpatients from July 2021 to May 2023 at a Daeat Korean medicine clinic in Seoul were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 3161 patients were evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and blood pressure (BP) index. Moreover, the treatment response to IKMT in the 24 best cases (WL within BMI < 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was evaluated using BIA and BP index, and the safety profile was determined by analyzing AEs. <b>Results</b>: The mean age was 38.2 ± 11.39 years, and the mean duration of treatment was 142.62 ± 104.92 days (approximately 20 weeks). The mean WL was 8.02 ± 6.67 kg (change from the baseline, 8.71%). Of the 3161 participants, 2146 had a WL of ≥5%. The best-case subgroup (<i>n</i> = 24; age 36.54 ± 11.64 years) achieved 23.02 ± 4.07 kg WL and reached BMIs < 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in 7.83 ± 2.54 months; among those with BP indices available (<i>n</i> = 21), reductions were statistically significant. In this subgroup, the mean treatment duration was 8.71 ± 2.46 months (range, 5-15), exceeding the 6-month safety guideline for Ephedrae Herba-containing HM, and no serious AEs were observed. At the 7-month follow-up, 11 patients maintained a statistically significant WL. <b>Conclusions</b>: This is the first Korean study to apply the professional collaboration of IKMT and dietician-led LM to people with obesity. IKMT combined with LM appears to be a safe and effective approach for obesity management. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish standardized treatment protocols.",2025,[],[]
The role of epicardial adipose tissue remodelling in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing global health problem characterized by high morbidity and mortality, with limited effective therapies available. Obesity significantly influences haemodynamic and structural changes in the myocardium and vasculature, primarily through the accumulation and action of visceral adipose tissue. Particularly, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) contributes to HFpEF through inflammation and lipotoxic infiltration of the myocardium. However, the precise signalling pathways leading to diastolic stiffness in HFpEF require further elucidation. This review explores the dynamic role of EAT in health and disease. Drawing upon insights from studies in other conditions, we discuss potential EAT-mediated inflammatory pathways in HFpEF and how they may contribute to functional and structural myocardial and endothelial derangements, including intramyocardial lipid infiltration, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, cardiomyocyte stiffening, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Lastly, we propose potential targets for novel therapeutic avenues.",2025,"['eat', 'eat']",[]
New Perspectives in Modulating the Entero-Insular Axis in Pediatric Obesity.,"A growing global trend of adult obesity and the increasing prevalence of overweight/obesity in children indicate a higher risk in the future of adult diseases related to obesity. Current anti-obesity medications regulate appetite and metabolism by acting either in peripheral tissues or in the central nervous system. On the other hand, subsequent weight regain is a typical response to weight loss methods, and there is little evidence that current anti-obesity medications can help maintain long-term weight loss without causing a range of undesirable side effects. The combination of anti-obesity drugs targets multiple molecular pathways and structures in the central nervous system that are involved in weight regulation. This systematic review involves trials performed in pediatric populations, published up to 2025 and systematically searched on the ClinicalTrials.gov database, using ""Glucagon like peptide-1 analog, Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists"" as the criterion for the ""Intervention/treatment"" category. We evaluated the entero-insular axis in pediatric patients with obesity, along with the mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of the Glucagon like peptide-1receptor agonists. We analyzed incretin hormones and summarized the drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Our objective is to identify new treatment strategies as we improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity and the incretin axis.",2025,"['glucagon like peptide - 1', 'glucagon like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glucagon like peptide - 1receptor', 'incre', 'incre']","['glucagon like peptide 1', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']"
Development of a whole-exome sequencing kit to facilitate porcine biomedical research.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is important for porcine models to replicate gene mutations present in human diseases to improve the translatability of animal studies. In this study, the high efficacy of a whole exome sequencing kit was demonstrated for the improved pig reference genome (Sus scrofa 11.1) to profile biomedically relevant swine breeds and enable high-depth sequencing required for intratumor heterogeneity profiling.<h4>Results</h4>We identify a total of 751,624 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 113,597 insertions and deletions (INDELs) across 93 samples from 12 porcine breeds. The identified mutations and affected pathways are correlated to muscle-to-fat ratios between different porcine breeds and further inform their utility as models of obesity and cardiovascular disease. Finally, 7935 SNVs and 358 INDELs are present in an Oncopig hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line and samples from a single Oncopig HCC tumor, with pathways related to hepatic fibrosis, WNT/B-catenin, ATM signaling, and p53 signaling enriched.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results demonstrate the kit's high efficacy and utility for identifying mutations in the context of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer across a range of pig models used in biomedical research.",2025,"['wnt /', 'b - catenin', 'atm', 'p53']","['atm', 'p53']"
Impact of Western diet on milk miRNAs and target genes in offspring adipose tissue: modulation by betaine during suckling.,"<h4>Objective</h4>We investigated how a maternal Western diet (WD) affects milk microRNA (miRNA) profile and associates with metabolic programming in adipose tissues in pups. We also explored the impact of betaine supplementation during suckling, as betaine levels are reported to be reduced in WD-fed dams' milk.<h4>Methods</h4>A microarray analysis was performed to profile miRNA expression in dams' milk. Betaine levels were measured in the milk of dams and the plasma of their offspring. We also analyzed the expression of miRNA target genes in white and brown adipose tissues through gene expression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Our findings confirm decreased betaine levels in the milk of WD-fed dams and the plasma of their offspring. The miRNA screening identified 37 deregulated miRNAs (36 downregulated), with the following 6 as the most relevant: miR-223-3p; miR-32-5p; let-7i-5p; miR-140-5p; miR-29a-3p; and miR-29c-3p (downregulated). Some of their target genes were upregulated in brown and white adipose tissues, particularly those related to thermogenesis and browning. Betaine supplementation in pups demonstrated a slight protective effect in females by enhancing thermogenic capacity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results underscore the profound impact of a maternal WD on milk miRNA composition, potentially influencing gene expression, thermogenesis, and adiposity in the offspring, with sex-related differences.",2025,"['mir - 223 - 3p', 'mir - 32 - 5p', 'let - 7i - 5p', 'mir - 140 - 5p', 'mir - 29a - 3p', 'mir - 29c - 3p']",[]
"Circulating extracellular RNAs, myocardial remodeling, and elevated BMI in patients with acute coronary syndrome.","<h4>Objective</h4>Given the elevated mortality in individuals with acute coronary syndrome and increased adiposity, delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-associated adverse cardiac remodeling is critical for the identification of novel pathophysiological biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Circulating extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) regulate important biological processes and can serve as biomarkers of disease. This study aims to discover circulating extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) that serve as biomarkers of obesity-associated adverse cardiac remodeling in ACS survivors.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed extracellular RNA (ex-RNA) profiles in 296 survivors of acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the Transitions, Risks, and Actions in Coronary Events - Center for Outcomes Research and Education (TRACE-CORE) cohort. A total of 317 ex-RNAs were quantified, selected a priori based on prior findings from a large population-based study. We employed a two-step, mechanism-driven approach to identify ex-RNAs associated with echocardiographic phenotypes, including left atrial (LA) dimension, LA volume index, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV mass, and LV end-diastolic volume, then tested the relations of these ex-RNAs with obesity. We performed further bioinformatics analysis of the gene ontology categories and molecular pathways associated with predicted miRNA targets.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 45 ex-RNAs associated with at least one echocardiographic phenotype, of which miR-1185-1-3p, miR-550a-3p, and miR-885-5p were also associated with prevalent obesity. Bioinformatic analysis of their predicted gene targets (n=1,930) revealed enrichment in key pathways related to inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular toxicity, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, TGF-β signaling, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Targets such as DICER1, VEGF, and EPO were implicated. Gene ontology analysis further highlighted associations with angiogenesis, FGF signaling, and interleukin pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Among ACS survivors, we observed that miR-1185-1-3p, miR-550a-3p, and miR-885-5p were associated with both echocardiographic markers of adverse cardiac remodeling and elevated BMI. Relevance for patients: miR-1185-1-3p, miR-550a-3p, and miR-885-5p were associated with echocardiographic phenotypes and obesity and are potential biomarkers for adverse cardiac remodeling in obesity.",2025,"['mir - 1185 - 1 - 3p', 'mir - 550a - 3p', 'mir - 885 - 5p', 'wnt', 'β - catenin', 'tgf - β', 'hypoxia - inducible factor', 'hif', 'dicer1', 'vegf', 'epo', 'fgf', 'interleukin', 'mir - 1185 - 1 - 3p', 'mir - 550a - 3p', 'mir - 885 - 5p', 'mir - 1185 - 1 - 3p', 'mir - 550a - 3p', 'mir - 885 - 5p']","['wnt', 'tgf β', 'hif', 'dicer1', 'vegf', 'epo', 'fgf', 'interleukin']"
Nanoparticle-Delivered Rutin Prevents Metabolic and Oxidative Imbalance in Obesity Triggered by a High-Fat Diet: In Vivo and In Silico Studies.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity, characterized by an abnormal and excessive accumulation of fat, significantly affects health by increasing the probability of chronic diseases and has become a pressing global health issue. Among natural compounds with therapeutic potential, rutin exhibits diverse biological effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic properties. <b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this work is to evaluate the preventive effects of rutin loaded on chitosan nanoparticles on metabolic and oxidative alterations in male albino rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). <b>Method:</b> The rats were allocated to four distinct groups: control, HFD, HFD treated with 50 mg/kg rutin, and HFD treated with 50 mg/kg nano-rutin, respectively, for six weeks. Results: Molecular docking analysis revealed that rutin exhibits an inhibitory interaction with PPAR-γ, suggesting its potential role in suppressing adipogenesis and contributing to its preventive effect against obesity. Nano-rutin markedly improved glycemic control, reducing fasting glucose from 161.75 ± 8.37 mg/dL in the HFD group to 133.50 ± 3.55 mg/dL, compared to 92.17 ± 3.53 mg/dL in controls. Serum leptin levels decreased from 28.95 ± 1.06 ng/mL in the HFD group to 15.58 ± 0.65 ng/mL with nano-rutin, approaching the control value of 10.43 ± 0.80 ng/mL. Oxidative stress was also significantly alleviated, as shown by a reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) from 8.43 ± 0.20 U/µL in HFD rats to 6.57 ± 0.08 U/µL with nano-rutin, versus 1.29 ± 0.13 U/µL in controls. <b>Conclusions:</b> Rutin loaded on chitosan nanoparticles demonstrated protective effects against high-fat diet-induced obesity, mainly through modulation of leptin signaling and oxidative stress pathways. These findings highlight the promise of nano-rutin as a natural agent for preventing metabolic disorders related to obesity.",2025,"['r', 'r', '##n', 'ppar - γ', 'leptin', 'rutin', 'leptin']","['leptin', 'rutin']"
Increased cholesterol interactions in the active conformational state of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor.,"The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a class B G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an important role in metabolic regulation and consequently is a target for type 2 diabetes and obesity therapeutics. Although cholesterol has been reported to be implicated in receptor activation, its interactions with the receptor during the activation cycle have not been probed. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we have characterized the cholesterol interactions with GLP-1R in four conformational states: the inactive, partially active, GLP-1-bound active, and exenatide-bound active conformational states. We observed that the cholesterol hotspots vary between the receptor states with an increased enrichment of cholesterol around the receptor in the active conformational states. Importantly, more favorable interaction energetics and increased residence times of cholesterol were identified in the active conformational state of the receptor, although lower in magnitude than previously reported. Notably, subtle differences could be distinguished between the GLP-1- bound and exenatide-bound receptor, underlining the ligand-specific effects. Our findings emphasize the increased selectivity of cholesterol toward the active state of GLP-1R and highlight the role of conformational dynamics in receptor-lipid interplay. Our work helps to understand how cholesterol modulates GLP-1R, with potential effects on its role as a regulator in lipid metabolism, thereby opening avenues to leverage these lipid interactions in targeted drug therapy.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1r', 'class b g - protein - coupled receptor', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'glp 1']"
Food Minor Bioactive Compounds of Polyphenolic and Polyprenolic Nature Are Promising Agents for the Prevention and Therapy of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is among the most prevalent liver disorders globally, affecting approximately 25% to 40% of the adult population. Closely associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, NAFLD presents a growing burden due to its increasing incidence and high healthcare costs. In this context, the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies remains a pressing challenge in modern medicine. This review aims to analyze current scientific evidence on bioactive plant compounds-particularly polyphenols and polyprenols-including their natural sources, mechanisms of action, and potential applications in the prevention and dietary management of NAFLD. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that both polyphenols and polyprenols exert hepatoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic effects. These compounds modulate signaling pathways implicated in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, positively influence gut microbiota composition, and affect bile acid metabolism. Studies have confirmed the efficacy of polyphenol-rich foods (naringenin, resveratrol, chlorogenic acid, etc.) and polyprenol-based formulations in reducing body weight and liver steatosis, improving biochemical markers and insulin resistance. The combined application of polyphenols and polyprenols may yield synergistic effects on multiple pathogenic pathways and represents a promising direction for the dietary prevention and management of NAFLD.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']

"Investigating the Pharmacological Impact of Atosiban, an Oxytocin Receptor Antagonist, on Bladder and Prostate Contractions Within OBESE and Non-Obese Rats.","<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as frequency, urgency, nocturia, and urge incontinence, are commonly linked to overactive bladder (OAB) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) upregulation has been proposed to enhance bladder and prostate contractility, while obesity is a recognized risk factor for LUTS, OAB, and BPH. This study aimed to investigate whether the OXTR antagonist atosiban attenuates spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractions in bladder and prostate tissues from obese and non-obese rats. <b>Methods:</b> Bladder and prostate tissues were obtained from obese and non-obese rats and studied in in vitro organ bath preparations. The effects of atosiban (1 µM and 10 µM) on spontaneous contractility and oxytocin-induced responses were examined. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate OXTR expression in the bladder. <b>Results:</b> Atosiban significantly reduced spontaneous contractions in the bladder (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 in obese; <i>p</i> < 0.01 in non-obese) and prostate (<i>p</i> < 0.01 in obese; <i>p</i> < 0.0001 in non-obese). Oxytocin-induced bladder contractions were significantly increased in obese rats but were attenuated by atosiban at 10 µM (<i>p</i> < 0.05), an effect absent in non-obese rats. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed elevated OXTR expression in both epithelial and stromal compartments of the bladder in obese rats (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings indicate that oxytocin contributes to bladder and prostate hypercontractility, particularly in obesity. Targeting OXTR with atosiban may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of LUTS, OAB, and BPH.",2025,"['oxytocin receptor', 'oxtr', 'oxtr', 'atosiban', 'oxytocin', 'atosiban', 'oxytocin', 'oxtr', 'atosiban', 'oxytocin', 'atosiban', 'oxtr', 'oxytocin', 'oxtr', 'atosiban']","['oxytocin receptor', 'oxtr', 'atosiban', 'oxytocin']"
Pharmacological activation of NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase ameliorates obesity-induced arterial stiffness.,"<h4>Background & purpose</h4>Arterial stiffness, or loss of elastic compliance in large arteries, is an independent precursor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1] and dementia [2] for which currently there are no targeted therapies. We previously discovered that decreases in NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC), the NO receptor which synthesizes cGMP, and in its target vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (pVASP<sup>S239</sup>), lead to increased cytoskeletal actin polymerization in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributing to increased arterial stiffness [3]. In the current study, we tested whether activating NO-GC with an NO-GC activator (cinaciguat) modulates pVASP<sup>S239</sup> and cytoskeletal actin polymerization in VSMCs, thereby preventing obesity-induced arterial stiffness.<h4>Experimental approach & key results</h4>Cinaciguat administration (5 mg/kg) to high fat, high sucrose diet (HFHS)-fed mice, our established model of arterial stiffness [4], (1) decreased pulse wave velocity, the in vivo index of arterial stiffness, without affecting blood pressure; (2) increased aortic pVASP<sup>S239</sup> levels; and (3) decreased actin polymerization, measured as ratio of filamentous (F) to globular (G) actin, compared to vehicle administration. In cultured VSMCs, cinaciguat (10 μmol/L) increased pVASP<sup>S239</sup> levels and decreased the F/G actin ratio at baseline and after stimulation with the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which we previously showed is significantly increased in the aorta of HFHS-fed mice [4-6]. These effects were abrogated in aortas and VSMCs from mice with smooth muscle-specific cGKI deletion (cGKI<sup>SMKO</sup>), while being mimicked by a cell-permeable cGMP analog (8-Br-cGMP), which also decreased VSMC stiffness in vitro.<h4>Conclusions & implications</h4>Collectively, our data strongly support the notion that pharmacological NO-GC activation would be beneficial in decreasing obesity-associated arterial stiffness by decreasing VSMC cytoskeletal actin hyper-polymerization. If translated to humans, NO-GC activators could become a viable approach to clinically treat arterial stiffness, which remains an unmet medical need.",2025,"['no - sensitive guanylyl cyclase', 'no - gc', 'cgmp', 'vasodila', 'phos', '##oprotein', 'pvasp', 'actin', 'no - gc', 'no - gc activator', 'cinaciguat', 'pvas', 'actin', 'pvasp', 'actin', 'actin', 'pvasp', '/', 'actin', 'tumor necrosis factor α', 't', '##nfα', 'smooth muscle - specific cgki', 'cgki', 'actin']","['cgmp', 'actin', 'cinaciguat', 'pva', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'cgki']"
Metabolic Problems Among People With Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia are Not Unique to Clozapine.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is unclear whether treatment with clozapine, when compared directly with other antipsychotics, is differentially associated with metabolic problems among people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). We evaluated the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and hypertension, and parameters such as glucose, lipids, weight, and blood pressure of people with TRS managed on clozapine and non-clozapine antipsychotics.<h4>Methods</h4>Demographic, clinical, and metabolic data of patients with TRS who commenced clozapine between 2006 and 2016 at a public hospital were collected in 2023. Participants were divided into those who were on clozapine and those who had discontinued clozapine and were on other antipsychotics when the data were collected. Metabolic disorders of the 2 groups were compared with the t test, the χ 2 test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. The significance level was set at P <0.05.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred six participants with TRS were on treatment with clozapine, and 41 with other antipsychotics. The participants' mean age was 44.3 (SD: 10.2) years, and 74.1% were males. Metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia (45.6%), obesity (37.4%), and diabetes (22.1%) were prevalent among people with TRS. However, there was no significant difference in diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, and parameters such as blood sugar, lipid levels, and blood pressure between the clozapine and non-clozapine cohorts. While dyslipidaemia was significantly higher among those who were managed on clozapine, 75% of them were prescribed statins.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A comprehensive approach addressing a broad range of risk factors, rather than solely focusing on clozapine, could be beneficial when evaluating and treating metabolic problems among people with TRS.",2025,[],[]
"Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): the interplay of gut microbiome, insulin resistance, and diabetes.","The global prevalence of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) has reached alarming levels, affecting nearly one-third of the world's population. This review analyzes current evidence on the intricate relationships between MASLD, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with particular emphasis on gut microbiome interactions. As MASLD progresses from simple steatosis to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), it can lead to severe complications including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of MASLD is multifactorial, involving hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulation of the gut-liver axis. Insulin resistance is a central driver of disease progression, closely linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent research highlights how gut microbiome dysbiosis exacerbates MASLD through mechanisms such as increased intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and altered metabolic signaling. Identification of microbial signatures offers promise for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. By integrating metabolic, inflammatory, and microbial perspectives, this review provides a comprehensive overview of MASLD pathogenesis and its association with obesity, insulin resistance, and T2DM.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
"Harnessing adiponectin for sepsis: current knowledge, clinical insights and future therapies.","Adiponectin, a key adipokine primarily secreted by adipocytes, plays crucial roles in metabolic homeostasis and inflammation, exhibiting anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its various isoforms and signaling via receptors like AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and T-cadherin contribute to its diverse biological functions. Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome triggered by a dysregulated host response to infection, leading to systemic inflammation, multi-organ failure, and high mortality, currently lacking specific treatments. Preclinical studies largely suggest a protective role for adiponectin, demonstrating that its deficiency exacerbates inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, while its administration or agonism improves outcomes in experimental sepsis models. Clinical findings, however, present a complex picture, with inconsistent correlations between adiponectin levels and sepsis outcomes reported, suggesting its potential as a dynamic biomarker influenced by disease stage, patient heterogeneity, and isoforms, rather than a simple prognostic factor. Notably, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), used in obesity and diabetes management, have been shown to increase adiponectin levels, linking metabolic therapies to potential sepsis immunomodulation. Consequently, targeting adiponectin signaling, either directly with adiponectin mimics like AdipoRon or indirectly via strategies like GLP-1RA administration, represents a promising therapeutic approach for sepsis. Harnessing the adiponectin axis holds potential for advancing precision medicine in critical care, necessitating further research into adiponectin-based interventions and synergistic metabolic therapies to improve sepsis outcomes.",2025,"['adiponectin', 'adipor1', 'adipor2', 't - cadherin', 'adiponectin', 'adiponectin', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor agonists', 'glp - 1ras', 'adiponectin', 'adiponectin', 'adiponectin', '##iporon', 'glp - 1ra', 'adiponectin', 'adiponectin']","['adiponectin', 'adipor1', 'adipor2', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists']"
Oral Semaglutide as an Opportunity for an Appropriate Therapeutic Switch in People with Type 2 Diabetes: A Delphi Consensus.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The expanding range of therapeutic options for type 2 diabetes (T2D) calls for a reassessment of clinical scenarios in which existing glucose-lowering therapies might be substituted with the oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide (OS). In light of the numerous unresolved questions, a panel of experts was convened to develop practical guidance for clinicians using the Delphi consensus method.<h4>Methods</h4>A panel of 13 experts formulated 31 statements addressing the following clinical scenarios: switch from injectable GLP-1 RA to OS; switch from sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor to OS; switch from insulin to OS; switch from dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) to OS; switch from ""old"" oral therapies (i.e., sulfonylureas, glinides, pioglitazone, acarbose) to OS. A panel of 28 diabetologists from the Emilia-Romagna region evaluated each statement by assigning a relevance score on a 9-point scale via a dedicated online platform. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was employed to determine the presence of disagreement among panelists.<h4>Results</h4>Panelists showed agreement for all 31 statements, all considered relevant. Panelists agreed that in many circumstances OS can represent a valuable alternative to injectable GLP-1 RAs, other oral glucose-lowering drugs, and insulin. The selection of OS is justified by its proven effectiveness in reducing glycated hemoglobin and body weight, as well as its positive impact on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, OS can allow a simplification of therapy in patients treated with insulin.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In an ever-evolving therapeutic landscape, OS therapy stands as a valuable option in the management of patients with T2D.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 r', 'glp - 1 ra', 'sodium - glucose cotransporter 2', 'insulin', 'dipeptidyl peptidase 4', 'glp - 1 ras', 'insulin', 'hemoglobin', 'insulin']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'insulin', 'dipeptidyl peptidase 4', 'hemoglobin']"
A Pilot Feasibility Study Exploring the Preliminary Effectiveness of an AI-Driven Virtual Human Intervention for General Practitioner Obesity Education and Communication-Skills Training.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rising global obesity rates demand effective weight management strategies from general practitioners (GPs). However, time constraints, training gaps, and low confidence often impede GPs' ability to conduct weight-based conversations. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an AI-driven Virtual Human (VH) obesity education and communication-skills training tool, specifically designed to address these challenges and enhance obesity education and communication-skills among GPs.<h4>Methods</h4>A pilot feasibility study with a pre-post survey design evaluated the impact of the VH tool on knowledge, self-efficacy, empathy toward patients with obesity, and confidence in clinical consultations. Participant perceptions, trust, and intention to use the VH tool were explored. Paired-sample <i>t</i>-tests were conducted to evaluate within-group mean differences. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 22 GPs were recruited. Despite some attrition, significant improvements were observed in knowledge (<i>p</i> = 0.006), self-efficacy (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and combined empathy and confidence scores (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Alongside these improvements, participants demonstrated positive perceptions of the tool, high trust in the VH, and a strong intention to implement the learned strategies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This pilot study demonstrates the potential of an AI-driven VH tool to enhance GP obesity education and communication skills. The observed improvements in key outcomes support the potential of VH technology in medical education on obesity. To further establish the efficacy and explore the broader applicability, future research should focus on larger, controlled trials across various provider groups.

The Dual Role of Perivascular Adipose Tissue in Vascular Homeostasis and Atherogenesis: From Physiology to Pathological Implications.,"Atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall, in which perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has evolved from a passive structural component to a key player in regulating vascular homeostasis and the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, playing an active, not just structural, role. PVAT surrounds blood vessels and influences them metabolically, immunologically, and vascularly by secreting adipokines, cytokines, and other bioactive mediators. Under physiological conditions, PVAT has protective roles, as it produces adiponectin, nitric oxide (NO), and other vasodilatory factors that help maintain vascular tone and reduce inflammation. In particular, brown-like PVAT (rich in Uncoupling Protein-1 (UCP1) and mitochondria) offers significant vasoprotective effects. Under pathological conditions (obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance), PVAT undergoes a phenotypic transition towards a pro-inflammatory profile by increasing leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion and decreasing adiponectin, contributing to endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, local immune cell recruitment, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and fibrosis. PVAT plays a complex role in vascular health and disease, interacting with systemic metabolism through the secretion of bioactive molecules. Metabolic imbalances can promote PVAT inflammation. Epigenetic alterations and micro ribonucleic acid (miRNAs) can influence PVAT inflammation, and modern imaging methods for PVAT assessment, such as the fat attenuation index (FAI) and artificial intelligence-assisted radiomic profiling, may become predictive biomarkers of cardiac risk. Future directions aim to identify biomarkers and develop targeted therapies that modulate PVAT inflammation and dysfunction in the context of cardiovascular diseases.",2025,"['adiponectin', 'uncoupling protein - 1', 'ucp1', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'tumor necrosis factor - alpha', 'tnf - α', 'interleukin - 6', 'il - 6', 'adiponectin']","['adiponectin', 'uncoupling protein 1', 'ucp1', 'insulin', 'leptin', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'interleukin 6']"
"Effects of Brown Rice, Meal Replacements, and Anti-Obesity Drugs on Mitochondria in Obese Rats.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Obesity remains a critical global health challenge, intricately linked to poor dietary quality, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction.<h4>Purpose</h4>This study aimed to investigate the comparative effects of brown rice, meal replacements, and thiazolidinediones on mitochondrial abundance and gut microbiota composition in a rat model of diet-induced obesity.<h4>Methods and materials</h4>A total of twenty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to five groups: control, high-fat high-fructose diet, and three intervention groups receiving the same obesogenic diet supplemented with brown rice, meal replacement, or thiazolidinediones for twelve weeks. Mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue was quantified using fluorescent staining techniques, while gut microbiota composition was assessed by analyzing the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio through quantitative PCR.<h4>Results</h4>Significant differences were observed in fiber intake and gut microbiota composition across groups (p < 0.001). The brown rice (BR) group exhibited the highest fiber intake (6.36 ± 1.01 g/day) and a favorable Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (1.36 ± 0.09). Mitochondrial count was significantly higher in the meal replacement (MR) group (60 ± 4.08) compared to the HFHF group (30 ± 2.89; p < 0.001). These findings suggest that high-fiber dietary interventions may enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and improve gut microbial balance, providing metabolic benefits in diet-induced obese models.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings demonstrate that dietary fiber-rich interventions can modulate host metabolism through concurrent improvement of gut microbiota and mitochondrial function. Brown rice and meal replacements offer promising, non-pharmacological strategies for obesity management, while pharmacological agents such as thiazolidinediones may provide additive benefits through targeted mitochondrial enhancement. This study supports an integrated approach to metabolic health and underscores the significance of diet quality in the prevention and treatment of obesity.",2025,[],[]
Identification of serum biomarkers associated with microvascular functions in a long-term high-fat diet-induced obesity rat model.,"Serum biomarkers are crucial for identifying complications of obesity.

Rats in the HFD group were fed a high-fat diet for 23 weeks, whereas control rats received a standard diet. Microvascular function was assessed using the post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) test; PORH responses were measured in the right forelimbs using laser Doppler flowmetry. Serum samples were then collected to measure the aforementioned biomarkers. Results showed decreased PORH responses in the HFD group, indicating impaired microvascular function. Serum levels of leptin, MPO, CRP, LDL, and OXLDL were significantly higher in the HFD group. Strong correlations were observed between microvascular dysfunction and LDL, OXLDL, MPO, and CRP. No significant changes were found in VEGF or HDL levels. These findings suggest that increased LDL oxidation to OXLDL in obesity contributes to vascular impairment, likely due to increased oxidative stress and inflammation mediated by elevated MPO and CRP. Further research focusing on the roles of LDL, OXLDL, MPO, and CRP may provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying microvascular dysfunction in obesity.",2025,"['leptin', 'vascular endothelial growth factor', 'vegf', 'myeloperoxidase', 'mpo', 'c - reactive protein', 'crp', 'low - density lipoprotein', 'oxldl', 'low - density lipoprotein', 'ldl', 'leptin', 'mpo', 'crp', 'ldl', 'oxldl', 'ldl', 'oxldl', 'mpo', 'crp', 'vegf', 'hdl', 'ldl', 'mpo', 'crp', 'ldl', 'oxldl', 'mpo', 'crp']","['leptin', 'vascular endothelial growth factor', 'vegf', 'myeloperoxidase', 'mpo', 'c reactive protein', 'crp', 'low density lipoprotein', 'oxldl', 'ldl', 'hdl']"
Metabolic Dysregulation in Postmenopause: Implications for Knee Joint Health.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Osteoarthritis is a slowly evolving joint disorder defined by cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, subchondral bone hardening, and the growth of osteophytes. Increasing evidence highlights the role of metabolic factors in osteoarthritis onset and progression. This study investigated the link between metabolic syndrome and the level of knee impairment in postmenopausal respondents suffering from knee osteoarthritis. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 200 participants aged 60-75 years with knee pain were enrolled in this observational cross-sectional study conducted between 2022 and 2023. The case group comprised 120 women with radiographically verified knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grades II-IV), while 80 age-matched women without radiographic changes served as controls. Clinical and anthropometric measures, metabolic indicators, and radiographic findings were collected. Functional status was assessed using the Lower Extremity Functional Scale and the Lequesne Index. <b>Results:</b> The groups differed significantly with respect to the presence of metabolic syndrome, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose level (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The metabolic syndrome showed modest but significant associations with radiographic knee damage (effect size 4.7%). After adjusting for smoking status and physical activity level, metabolic syndrome remained significantly associated with radiographic damage (effect sizes: 4.8 and 2.2%, respectively). Participants with osteoarthritis but without metabolic syndrome had better functional knee status compared to those with metabolic syndrome (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> In postmenopausal women, metabolic syndrome is independently associated with radiographic knee damage and contributes to poorer functional outcomes in participants with knee osteoarthritis, underscoring its potential role as a modifiable risk factor.",2025,[],[]
Novel approaches and applications in identifying DNA methylation markers of cardio-kidney-metabolic disease.,"Cardio-kidney-metabolic (CKM) diseases represent a major public health challenge, accounting for a large proportion of global burden of morbidity and mortality. These conditions share risk factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and lifestyle influences, which collectively drive disease development and progression. Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm), serve as key mediators and biomarkers between these risk factors and disease phenotypes by regulating gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenome-wide association studies have identified DNAm markers associated with CKM diseases and related phenotypes, highlighting both shared pathways and disease-specific epigenetic signatures in inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and aging-related processes. Longitudinal studies further demonstrate the dynamic nature of DNAm changes over time, offering insights into disease trajectories. Additionally, methylation risk scores integrating multiple epigenetic markers show promise in improving disease prediction and risk stratification beyond traditional clinical factors. To synthesize the current evidence, we conducted a targeted literature search in PubMed for English-language, peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and the present. Future research leveraging large, well-phenotyped cohorts, advanced statistical methods, and innovative study designs will be critical for uncovering novel biomarkers, refining risk prediction models, and developing targeted epigenetic therapies to mitigate the global burden.",2025,[],[]

Metabolic Dysregulation and Female Infertility: A Systematic Review of Hormonal and Reproductive Outcomes From Recent Clinical Trials.,"This systematic review explores the influence of metabolic and immunological interventions on hormonal and fertility outcomes in infertile women with metabolic disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The review synthesizes findings from rigorously selected randomized and crossover trials published between 2015 and 2024, focusing on interventional approaches aimed at improving reproductive and endocrine parameters. Studies were screened and assessed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and relevant outcomes included ovulation, oocyte quality, pregnancy rates, and changes in hormonal markers, such as insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol. The analysis reveals that metabolic dysregulation significantly alters reproductive outcomes and that targeted interventions, ranging from pharmacological agents and dietary modifications to experimentally induced metabolic states, can have measurable effects on hormonal profiles and fertility. While some interventions demonstrated clear improvements in ovulatory and metabolic markers, others primarily highlighted associations rather than causality. Despite variations in sample sizes and methodological designs, the review underscores the need for integrated therapeutic strategies addressing both metabolic and hormonal dysfunction in this population. The findings support a multifaceted approach to managing infertility in women with metabolic disturbances, emphasizing the potential for tailored interventions to optimize both endocrine and reproductive health.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'luteinizing hormone', 'lh', 'follicle - stimulating hormone', 'fsh']","['insulin', 'luteinizing hormone', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'fsh']"
A brief online tool to increase behavioral weight loss treatment initiation: Protocol for a cluster randomized trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Comprehensive behavioral weight loss treatments are the first-line approach for obesity in adults. However, only a small portion of eligible individuals will initiate treatment, even when available at low or no cost. To address low uptake, we developed the MyHealthPath Tool, a single-session, online, interactive tool designed to be completed prior to a primary care appointment. MyHealthPath Tool includes questions and automated personalized feedback to increase motivation to initiate a behavioral weight loss treatment.<h4>Method/design</h4>In this cluster randomized controlled trial, primary care practitioners (PCPs; target N = 36) are being recruited from primary care clinics across multiple sites of a single academic-affiliated health care system, then randomized to the MyHealthPath Tool or Control condition. Patients (target N = 828) who have upcoming appointments with enrolled PCPs are recruited prior to their PCP appointment. Patients in both conditions are given information about and free access to two behavioral weight loss treatments. Participants in the MyHealthPath Tool condition also receive the tailored interactive tool and the option to share a summary of their responses with their PCP prior to their appointment. The primary outcome is the initiation of behavioral weight loss treatment within 2 months of the patient's PCP appointment. Secondary outcomes include treatment attendance and weight change over 6 months. Implementation-related outcomes (e.g., indicators of reach) are also being measured.<h4>Conclusion</h4>If effective, MyHealthPath could serve as a low-touch method for improving uptake of behavioral weight loss treatment in adults receiving primary care.",2025,[],[]
Glia maturation factor-β deficiency improves insulin resistance by promoting CARM1-mediated lipid turnover.,"Insulin resistance (IR) is a major factor for obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of IR and its systemic control remain poorly understood, and pharmacological drugs to ameliorate IR are an unmet need. So finding new therapeutic targets and drugs is important. Here, we report that glia maturation factor-β (GMFB), a growth and differentiation factor for glia and neurons, is a systemic regulator of IR, and we developed its inhibitor. We found that GMFB expression in adipose tissue is related to IR in rats, mice and humans. Systemic or adipocyte-specific Gmfb depletion improved IR and the lipotoxicity of plasma long chain fatty acids. Gmfb KO promotes lipid turnover (adipogenesis and lipid removal (lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation)) in adipocytes. Mechanistically, GMFB was degraded via chaperone-mediated autophagy under insulin stimulation in adipocytes. Gmfb KO boosted its interacting protein coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) nuclear translocation to coactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), thereby promoting lipid turnover in adipocytes to improve IR. DS19, a potential GMFB inhibitor, showed strong insulin sensitizing effect by attenuating GMFB-CARM1 interaction. In conclusion, our results uncover GMFB, regulating adipocyte lipid turnover, as a novel therapeutic target in obesity-induced IR. The GMFB inhibitor DS19 will merit further clinical investigation.",2025,"['insulin', 'glia maturation factor - β', 'gmfb', 'gmfb', 'gmfb', 'gmfb', '##o', 'gmfb', 'insulin', 'gmfb', 'ko', 'arginine methyltransferase 1', 'carm1', 'peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma', 'pparγ', 'ds19', 'gmfb', 'insulin', 'gmfb', 'carm1', 'gmfb', 'gmfb', 'ds19']","['insulin', 'gmfb', 'carm1', 'peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma', 'pparγ']"
Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma and Body Mass Index: The Role of Immune System in Tumor Microenvironment.,"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is linked to obesity, but the biological mechanisms that may explain this connection have been only partially described. Potential factors that combine overweight/obesity with this cancer should be searched for in the immune pathways and chronic inflammation onset. In this study, we evaluated the role of the immune system in patients affected by PTC and stratified them according to Body Mass Index (BMI). An analysis of the expression profiles of >700 immune-related genes was performed in 36 PTCs, subdivided into four categories: underweight (A), normal weight (B), overweight (C), and subjects living with obesity (D). B was considered a reference category. In our study, the immune microenvironment of PTCs did not seem strongly influenced by BMI. However, based on the interaction from in silico protein-protein analysis, we found that the dysregulation profiles of groups A or D were similar as concerns pathways involved in T-cell differentiation, macrophage activation, regulation of the cell cycle, and senescence processes. Furthermore, we found significant downregulation of <i>HMGB1</i> in the A and D categories, with upregulation of <i>ARG2</i> in the D category. Although further studies are necessary, these genes may provide an opportunity to better understand immunometabolism in thyroid cancer.",2025,"['hmgb1', 'arg2']","['hmgb1', 'arg2']"
County-level association of diabetes and obesity with premature mortality.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The association between the prevalence of diabetes and obesity and premature mortality at the county-level has not been well characterized. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between county-level prevalence of diabetes and obesity and premature mortality.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized the data from the 2022 County Health Rankings which obtained the data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2019, and National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Files 2018-2020. The county prevalence of diabetes and obesity was determined, and univariable and multivariable associations with premature mortality were identified.<h4>Results</h4>Among 3082 counties, the percentage of individuals with diabetes ranged from 5.5 to 21.0 % and the percentage of individuals with obesity ranged from 16.4 to 51.0 %. Our analysis revealed a stepwise increase in premature age-adjusted death rates (AADR) with rising deciles of county-level diabetes (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and obesity (P < 0.001) in both univariable and multivariable models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings underscore the significance of addressing diabetes and obesity at the county-level to reduce premature mortality and improve population health outcomes across varied communities in the United States.",2025,[],[]
Systemic inflammation as a central player in the initiation and development of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. While the amyloid cascade hypothesis has long dominated AD research, emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may play a more central role in disease onset and progression. Increasingly, AD is recognized as a multifactorial disorder influenced by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation, shifting focus toward peripheral immune mechanisms as potential contributors to neurodegeneration. This review explores the hypothesis that inflammaging, the age-related increase in pro-inflammatory mediators, combined with lifelong exposure to infections, injuries, metabolic changes, and chronic diseases, among others, may prime the immune system, amplifying neuroinflammation and influencing the progression and exacerbation of AD pathology. To this end, we examined how systemic immune disturbances, including chronic pain, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, viral and bacterial infections, gut microbiome dysregulation, and cardiovascular disease, may act as risk factors for AD. Overall, evidence suggests that modulating peripheral inflammation, accompanied by early diagnosis, could significantly reduce the risk of developing AD. Furthermore, we highlight key immune signaling pathways involved in both central and peripheral immune responses, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and TREM2, which represent promising therapeutic targets for modulating inflammation while preserving protective immune functions. Strategies aimed at reducing systemic inflammation, identifying early biomarkers, and intervening before significant neurodegeneration occurs may provide novel approaches to delay or prevent AD onset. In conclusion, this review underscores the crucial role of systemic inflammation in AD pathogenesis and progression. By targeting peripheral immune dysfunction, we may advance our understanding of AD mechanisms and develop more effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate disease risk and progression.",2025,"['n', '##lrp3', 'trem2']",['trem2']
The functionally conserved human lncRNA motif GULF lowers glucose and lipid levels in obese mice.,"Growing evidence links human long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to metabolic disease pathogenesis, yet no FDA-approved drugs target human lncRNAs. Most human lncRNAs lack conservation in other mammals, complicating efforts to define their roles and identify therapeutic targets. Here, we leveraged the concept of functionally conserved lncRNAs (FCLs) - lncRNAs that share function despite no sequence similarity - to develop a framework for identifying human lncRNAs as therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders. We used expression quantitative trait loci mapping and functional conservation analyses to pinpoint human lncRNAs influenced by disease-associated SNPs and with potential functionally conserved mouse equivalents. We identified human and mouse GULLs (glucose and lipid lowering), which regulate glucose and lipid metabolism by binding CRTC2, thereby modulating gluconeogenic genes via CREB and lipogenic genes via SREBP1. Despite their lack of sequence similarity, both lncRNAs demonstrated similar metabolic effects in obese mice, with more pronounced benefits from long-term activation. To identify druggable sites, we mapped GULLs' binding motifs to CRTC2 (termed GULFs). Standalone human GULF, an RNA oligomer resembling FDA-approved siRNAs, significantly improved glucose and lipid levels in obese mice. This framework highlights functionally conserved human lncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets, exemplified by GULLs' potential as a glucose- and lipid-lowering therapeutic.",2025,"['g', 'crtc2', 'creb', 'srebp1', ""gulls ' binding motifs"", 'crtc2', 'gulfs', 'human gulf', 'gull']","['crtc2', 'creb', 'srebp1', 'gulf']"
Semaglutide 2.4 mg versus Liraglutide 3 mg for the Treatment of Obesity in Greece: A Short-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a global health issue with significant economic implications for health systems. Pharmacotherapy, including semaglutide 2.4 mg and liraglutide 3 mg, offers a treatment option for weight management; however, its cost-effectiveness requires evaluation. This study assesses the short-term cost-effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus liraglutide 3 mg in achieving clinically relevant weight loss targets at 68 weeks in Greece.<h4>Methods</h4>A short-term cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Greek third-party payer [National Organization for the Provision of Health Services (EOPYY)], comparing costs and outcomes for semaglutide 2.4 mg and liraglutide 3 mg over a 68-week horizon. Effectiveness was measured by the proportion of patients achieving weight loss targets of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, and ≥ 20%, using efficacy data from the STEP-8 head-to-head trial, a 68-week, randomized, double-blind study conducted in the USA, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg versus liraglutide 3 mg in adults who were overweight or had obesity without diabetes. Only direct medical costs were included, reflecting the payer perspective, and no discounting was applied owing to the short time horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the results' robustness.<h4>Results</h4>Semaglutide 2.4 mg had higher treatment costs (€3285.55) compared with liraglutide 3 mg (€2742.47) but demonstrated greater efficacy and a lower cost of control across all weight loss targets. The cost per patient achieving ≥ 5% weight loss was €3768.72 for semaglutide and €4718.66 for liraglutide, corresponding to a difference of €949.95 per patient. The cost difference widened at higher weight loss targets, with semaglutide showing differences of €6064.20 for ≥ 10% weight loss, €17,005.23 for ≥ 15%, and €37,296.00 for ≥ 20%. These findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Semaglutide 2.4 mg is likely to be a short-term, cost-effective treatment option for adults who are overweight or have obesity without diabetes in Greece.",2025,[],[]

Lipid overload meets S-palmitoylation: a metabolic signalling nexus driving cardiovascular and heart disease.,"S-palmitoylation has emerged as a critical integrator of lipid overload and cardiovascular dysfunction. Disordered lipid metabolism inundates endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages with triglyceriderich lipoproteins, oxidized LDL and saturated fatty acids, expanding the intracellular palmitoylCoA pool and perturbing redox balance. Protein Spalmitoylation, the reversible attachment of palmitate to cysteine residues, converts excess palmitoylCoA into broad alterations in signalling and membrane dynamics. The FASN-ACSL-ZDHHC axis channel excess fatty acids into palmitoylCoA, which is transferred to pivotal proteins including the lipid transporter CD36, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), key ion channels and the pyroptosis effector gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cycles of palmitate addition and removal regulate membrane residency, foam cell formation, nitric oxide production, calcium handling and inflammatory cell death, thereby linking lipid burden to atherosclerotic plaque growth, arrhythmogenic risk, heart failure progression and pulmonary hypertension. Therapeutic targeting of fatty acid uptake, palmitoyltransferases or thioesterases alleviates metabolic overload, restores endothelial reactivity and preserves myocardial viability in experimental models. This review synthesizes mechanistic and preclinical studies to delineate how lipiddriven protein palmitoylation reprograms cardiovascular physiology and pathology.",2025,"['ldl', 'fasn', 'acsl', 'zdhhc', 'cd36', 'endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'enos', 'gasdermin d', 'gsdmd', 'thioesterases']","['ldl', 'fasn', 'acsl', 'cd36', 'endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'enos', 'gasdermin d', 'gsdmd']"
The Prevalence and Predictive Risk Factors of Metabolic Syndrome Based on Health-Related Fitness Components in Omani Adolescents with Obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Significant linear trends indicate that rising adolescent obesity rates will increase the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and associated health risks. We aimed to initially determine the prevalence of MetS among adolescents (aged 13-16 yr) with obesity in the South Al Batinah governorate in Oman (n=3404) based on data collected in 2024. Then to predict the risk factors of MetS criteria based on health-related fitness (HRF) components to identify the most significant risk factors among them (n= 512, with BMIile% ≥95%).<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study was performed to determine the MetS prevalence. MetS criteria and HRF components were measured to examine key risk factors. Then, the predictive value of HRF variables for MetS incidence was assessed using multiple regression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The descriptive results from screening adolescents with obesity indicated that 10.7% of them exhibited MetS. A notable correlation between fast blood glucose (FBG) and cardiorespiratory fitness; CRF (r=0.28, <i>P</i>=0.001), waist circumference; WC (r=0.39, <i>P</i><0.0001), and BMI (r=0.46, <i>P</i><0.0001) were revealed.

Exploring the Feasibility of Daycase Pediatric Tonsillectomy in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Retrospective Review.,"Introduction Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, is one of the most commonly performed procedures in pediatric otolaryngology. Over the years, there has been a shift in postoperative practice from routine admissions to daycase procedures. The study aimed to evaluate the postoperative course of pediatric tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy in a local tertiary care hospital, and to compare our current practices with the internationally published data on the subject. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted at Tawam Hospital in the UAE. We included pediatric patients aged one to 15 years who underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy at our hospital. The study was conducted over a six-month period from December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024. Results A total of 65 patients were included in the study. Thirty-nine patients (60%) were admitted postoperatively, while 26 (40%) were discharged the same day. When the UK guidelines were applied, the suggested admissions dropped to 31 (47.7%), and the daycase procedures increased to 34 (52.3%). Both of the daycase rates were lower than the 80% target recommended by the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) programme. Conclusion Pediatric adenotonsillectomy still appears to be a safe daycare procedure in a tertiary care hospital. However, achieving an 80% daycase rate might not be possible in our population due to patients' specific factors.",2025,[],[]

"BCAA metabolism: the Achilles' heel of ovarian cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome, and premature ovarian failure.","Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), including valine, leucine and isoleucine, are essential nutrient signals that influence mammalian animal metabolism. Many enzymes are involved in the metabolism of BCAAs, such as branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCATs), branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), and BCKDH kinase (BCKDK). The aberrant expression of enzymes involved in BCAA metabolism and an imbalance in BCAA amino acid intake can lead to disordered metabolism. Aberrant BCAA metabolism can lead to several diseases, such as human ovarian disease, including ovarian cancer (OC), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and premature ovarian failure (POF), which are common gynaecological diseases. The overexpression of BCATs is found in OC, which promotes BCAA catalysis to provide a large amount of energy for tumorigenesis. However, BCKDK is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), which promotes proliferation and migration via MEK-ERK. In addition, several studies have reported that high levels of BCAAs are increased in the plasma of PCOS and POF patients. This review focuses on the role of BCAA metabolism and potential management methods for OC, PCOS and POF.",2025,"['branched - chain amino acid transaminases', 'bcats', 'branched - chain α - keto acid dehydrogenase', 'bckdh', 'bckdh kinase', 'bckdk', 'bcats', 'bckdk', 'mek', 'erk']","['bckdh', 'bckdh kinase', 'bckdk', 'mek', 'erk']"
Metabolomic Understanding of variable risk factors for kidney cancer: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circulating metabolites have been found to play an important role in the development of renal cancer, however, the specific pathways and mechanisms of their influence are still largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of metabolites in kidney cancer development and to explain the development of kidney cancer from a genetic perspective.<h4>Method</h4>We explored the role of plasma metabolites and urinary metabolites in kidney cancer using two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) separately and validated it using multiple databases; in addition, we performed rigorous tests of pleiotropy and heterogeneity to ensure that the results were robust. Next, we explored the role of common modifiable risk factors in kidney cancer and identified the specific mechanisms by which risk factors affect kidney cancer by joint analysis of TCGA and GEO databases.<h4>Results</h4>Through MR analysis, we identified six plasma metabolites and one urinary metabolite that play a major role in kidney cancer, confirmed the effects of BMI and type 1 diabetes mellitus on kidney cancer, and constructed the BMI-plasma metabolite-kidney cancer causality networks through mediated MR. In addition, we found that SLPI could significantly affect the prognosis of kidney cancer through multiple databases' joint analyses, and through multiple methods explored the pathways of SLPI's influence on kidney cancer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In a word, this study shows that BMI can significantly increase the risk of kidney cancer, while the plasma metabolites 4-guanidinobutanoate may partially mitigate this risk, and that SLPI promotes tumorigenesis in obesity-related renal cancer by regulating protease activity.",2025,['s'],[]
Amino Acid Metabolite Profiling for Predicting and Understanding the Metabolic Effects of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.,"Metabolic and bariatric surgery induces metabolic benefits beyond weight loss, including improved insulin sensitivity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission, and reduced inflammation.

Elevated preoperative levels of isoleucine, phenylalanine, levodopa, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid are associated with improved glycemic control and T2D remission. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-pyruvic acid, contribute to insulin sensitivity and lean mass preservation. Additionally, serotonin-related indicators predict postoperative weight loss rates. These metabolites reflect individual metabolic heterogeneity and may outperform conventional clinical models in predicting surgical responsiveness.

Investigating the Metabolic Benefits of Magnetic Mitohormesis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Exercise is a key pillar in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but adherence rates to physical activity are poor. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy, termed magnetic mitohormesis (MM), has been shown in preclinical and early human studies to mimic the metabolic benefits of exercise without physical strain. However, its effects on glycemic control remain unknown. We evaluate the metabolic benefits of MM in patients with suboptimally-controlled T2DM. <b>Methods</b>: An exploratory study was conducted in 40 adults with T2DM (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c 7.0-10.0%). MM treatment comprised 12 sessions organized weekly, where low-dose PEMF was delivered to alternate legs for 10 min per visit. Metabolic assessments-anthropometry, HbA1c, fasting glucose and insulin resistance (measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, HOMA-IR)-were measured at baseline and post-treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare the effects of MM on patients with and without central obesity (defined as waist-to-hip ratio ≥ 1.0). <b>Results</b>: Participants had a mean age of 59.4 years and HbA1c of 8.1%. MM treatment was well tolerated with no adverse events, and 77.5% of patients completed all 12 sessions. There were no significant changes in HbA1c, fasting glucose or HOMA-IR for the overall cohort.

Adult male Wistar rats received a standard diet or a high-fat (HF) diet for 12 weeks. A bolus injection of IGF-1 (50 μg/kg, i.p.) was administered to half of the HF rats 24 hours before euthanasia. IGF-1 treatment increased: the activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and expression of phosphorylated and total Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α<sub>1</sub> subunit, the phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor β /insulin receptor β at Tyr<sup>1131</sup>/Tyr<sup>1146</sup>, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Tyr<sup>1222</sup>, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) at Ser<sup>2481</sup>, protein kinase B (Akt) at Ser<sup>473</sup> and the expression of type-2 angiotensin II (AngII) receptor (AT<sub>2</sub>R). Conversely, IGF-1 reduced the levels of IRS-1 phosphorylated at Ser<sup>307</sup>, mTOR at Ser<sup>2448</sup>, ribosomal protein p70 S6 kinase (S6K) at Thr<sup>421</sup>/Ser<sup>424</sup>, and the expression of type-1 Ang II receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>R) in the heart, as well as the serum levels of Ang II in obese rats. IGF-1 treatment reduced cardiac mass and elevated mRNA expression of the α-myosin heavy chain (MHC), and the α/β MHC ratio in the hearts of obese rats. The results of this study suggest that the administration of IGF-1 to obese rats reduces the adverse effects of HF diet, potentially by lowering Ang II-mediated activation of mTOR/S6K and enhancing the IRS-1/Akt pathway, which promotes Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the heart and diminishes cardiac hypertrophy.",2025,"['insulin - like growth factor - 1', 'igf - 1', 'cardiac sodium / potassium adenosine triphosphatase', 'na < sup > + < / sup > / k < su', '> + < / sup > - atpase', 'igf - 1', 'igf - 1', 'na < sup > + < / su', '> / k < sup > + < / sup > - atpase', 'na < sup > + < / su', '> / k <', '> + < /', '> - atpase α <', '1 <', 'subunit', 'igf - 1 receptor β', 'insulin receptor β', 'insulin receptor substrate - 1', 'irs - 1', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor', 'protein kinase b', 'a', '##kt', 'type - 2 angiotensin ii ( angii ) receptor', 'igf - 1', 'irs - 1', 'mtor', 'ribosomal protein p70 s6 kinase', 's6k', 'type - 1 ang ii receptor', 'ang ii', 'igf - 1', 'α - myosin heavy chain', 'mhc', 'α / β mhc', 'igf - 1', 'ang ii', 'mtor', 's6k', 'irs - 1', 'a', '##kt', 'atpase']","['insulin like growth factor 1', 'insulin receptor substrate 1', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mtor', 'protein kinase b', 's6k', 'ang ii', 'mhc']"
Adipose tissue-derived microRNA-450a-5p induces type 2 diabetes mellitus by downregulating DUSP10.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has rapidly increased worldwide, emerging as the fifth leading cause of death. The treatment of T2DM is challenging due to the side effects of oral hypoglycemic drugs and the limited efficacy of long-term insulin therapy, which can lead to insulin resistance (IR). Consequently, there is significant in discovering new drugs that have minimal side effects and a pronounced hypoglycemic effect. In obesity, microRNA levels have been implicated in glucose metabolism disorders and T2DM, although many aspects remain unresolved. Here, we confirmed that visceral adipose tissue and serum microRNA-450a-5p content increased under obesity and T2DM, and it was significantly positively associated with fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins-cholesterol levels of the subjects. In high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, microRNA-450a-5p expression was increased in the serum, liver, and white adipose tissue. Moreover, the adipose Dicer-knockout mouse model was constructed to identify adipose tissue as the main source of microRNA-450a-5p. microRNA-450a-5p could inactivate the insulin signal pathway by targeting the inhibited Dual Specificity Phosphatase 10 (DUSP10) and inducing IR and glucose metabolism disorders in vitro cultured hepatocytes and adipocytes. Additionally, microRNA-450a-5p was found to regulate DUSP10 expression and insulin signaling activity, influencing glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity across various models, including normal diet, HFD-induced obese, adipose tissue-specific microRNA-450a-5p-knockout, and db/db mice. Furthermore, gallic acid might play a potential role in inhibiting glucose levels by decreasing microRNA-450a-5p expression. Thus, microRNA-450a-5p emerges as an attractive therapeutic target for addressing obesity, IR, and T2DM.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'low - density lipoproteins - cholesterol', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'dicer', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'insulin', 'dual', 'specificity phosphatase 10', 'dusp10', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'dusp10', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'microrna - 450a - 5p', 'microrna - 450a - 5p']","['insulin', 'dicer', 'dusp10']"
Normoglycemia and Weight Reduction: Perspectives of People with Type 2 Diabetes in Australia.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>As more treatments become available to normalize glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and reduce weight, it is important to understand the meaningfulness of achieving target HbA1c levels and weight reduction from the perspective of people with type 2 diabetes.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This is a cross-sectional survey of 300 Australians with type 2 diabetes.<h4>Results</h4>Achieving target HbA1c levels was meaningful to 90.0% (n=198) and moderately/very/extremely important to 94.5% (n=208) of the 220 participants with HbA1c >6.0%. Over half of the participants were dissatisfied with their current weight (n=158, 52.7%) and underreported their body mass index category (n=160, 53.3%). For 59.0% (n=177), a mean (±standard deviation) of 17.2 (±20.6) kg of weight loss was meaningful. Of these participants, 10.7%, 30.5%, 21.5%, and 37.3% viewed 5%, 5-10%, 10%-15%, and >15% of weight reduction as meaningful, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>According to this survey, achieving target HbA1c levels is both meaningful and important to most people with type 2 diabetes. Achieving weight reduction is also seen as important despite frequent underrating of body mass index. Therapies targeting both target HbA1c levels and weight reduction may be of interest to people with type 2 diabetes in Australia, and this could impact medication adherence and health outcomes.",2025,"['hemoglobin', 'hba1', 'h', 'hba1', 'h', 'hba1']","['hemoglobin', 'hba1']"
The Relationship Between Obesity Status and Body Image Dissatisfaction on Gross Motor Skill Development and Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Children Aged 6-12 Years Old.,"<h4>Background</h4>The harmonious development of gross motor skills (GMSs) is vital for children, fostering their physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional growth. This study aimed to achieve three primary objectives: (1) to establish standardized reference values for all GMS tests conducted; (2) to examine the impact of overweight and obesity on factors influencing the development of GMSs and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF); and (3) to investigate the relationship between GMSs and CRF levels and body image dissatisfaction among Canadian children from the province of Québec.<h4>Methods</h4>The study encompassed 3144 children aged 6 to 12 years (1535 boys and 1609 girls) recruited from 24 elementary schools situated in five urban areas. Anthropometric measurements included body mass, body height, and body mass index (BMI). Physical performance was assessed using a maximal aerobic power test and 12 GMS tests, which comprised two segmental speed tests, four agility tests, two static balance tests, one simple reaction time test, and three coordination tests. Body perception and body image dissatisfaction were evaluated using a silhouette scale featuring two sets of nine drawings depicting a spectrum of body shapes ranging from very thin to obese.<h4>Results</h4>Standardized normative values were established for each GMS test. GMSs demonstrated continuous improvement throughout childhood, albeit with a deceleration in progress during later developmental stages. At comparable age, boys generally outperformed girls on tests demanding greater strength, speed, or endurance, whereas girls exhibited superior performance in balance and hand-foot coordination tasks (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). However, segmental speed remained equivalent between sexes (<i>p</i> > 0.05). GMS and CRF were significantly influenced by obesity status. Children with a normal BMI demonstrated superior performance compared to their overweight or obese counterparts, particularly in tests requiring body mass displacement (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). Conversely, socioeconomic status exhibited no significant impact on body perception in boys (<i>p</i> = 0.106), but it was a notable factor among 6-8-year-old girls from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (<i>p</i> = 0.045).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Obesity status is linked to diminished GMS performance, especially in tasks involving body mass movement. These findings underscore the importance of early intervention strategies to encourage an active lifestyle and promote a healthy body composition in children.",2025,[],[]
Metabolic Syndrome in Older Adults: Through the Lens of Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) 4Ms Framework and Social Determinants of Health.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS)-characterized by dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and abdominal obesity-is a common, modifiable condition that contributes to functional decline and premature mortality in older adults. The accumulation of MetS components increases the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases, as well as cognitive impairment and polypharmacy in aging populations. A narrative review was conducted focusing on the management of MetS in adults aged 65 and older. Sources were identified through targeted searches of PubMed and relevant guidelines, with an emphasis on literature discussing geriatric-specific considerations. The review was structured using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) 4Ms Framework: What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility. Findings highlight that current MetS guidelines are often extrapolated from younger populations and insufficiently account for geriatric-specific factors such as altered pharmacokinetics, multimorbidity, and social determinants of health. The 4Ms Framework provides a comprehensive lens to adapt these guidelines, supporting individualized treatment plans that consider patient goals, cognitive status, and functional capacity. Incorporating social services and aligning interventions with socioeconomic realities can further bridge disparities in care. The 4Ms framework can help healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients, ensuring treatment plans align with evidence-based practices and the patient's individual priorities. Treatment of MetS must be tailored to individual patient needs based on presented risk factors, severity of risks, and social determinants of health. Adjusting treatment plans in accordance with the socioeconomic status (SES) of patients will allow for systematic improvement of outcomes.",2025,[],[]
Lipid Accumulation and Insulin Resistance: Bridging Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a recently proposed term to replace non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), emphasizes the critical role of metabolic dysfunction and applies broader diagnostic criteria. Diagnosis of MAFLD requires evidence of hepatic steatosis combined with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or other metabolic dysregulation conditions, all of which significantly elevate the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review discusses the pathological mechanisms of lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in MAFLD and CKD, highlighting their mechanistic connections. Specifically, ectopic fat accumulation triggered by metabolic reprogramming, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by energy overload, modified lipids, uremic toxins, and senescence, as well as insulin resistance pathways activated by pro-inflammatory factors and lipotoxic products, collectively exacerbate simultaneous hepatic and renal injury. Moreover, interactions among hyperinsulinemia, the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and altered adipokine and hepatokine profiles further amplify insulin resistance, ectopic lipid deposition, and systemic damage. Finally, the review explores potential therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and RAS activity, which offer promise for dual-organ protection and improved outcomes in both hepatic and renal systems.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'renin', 'angiotensin', 'ras', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'ras']","['insulin', 'renin', 'angiotensin', 'ras']"
Association Between Depression and Hepatic Steatosis According to Obese Status: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2019.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Hepatic steatosis is associated with an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Although numerous studies have reported associations between depression, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, the relationship between depression and hepatic steatosis has not yet been fully elucidated. Moreover, obesity is a shared risk factor for hepatic steatosis and depression; however, few studies have adequately adjusted for obesity as a potential confounder. In this study, we investigated the association between depression and hepatic steatosis stratified by obese and non-obese status. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This study used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare between 2010 and 2019, which was a cross-sectional and nationally representative study of non-institutionalized civilians using a stratified, multistage, clustered probability sampling design. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between depression and hepatic steatosis in the groups stratified by obese status. <i>Results</i>: Of 80,861 participants, data from 45,307 were included in the analysis. The prevalence of non-obese and obese hepatic steatosis was 3.1% and 19.3%, respectively, and the prevalence of diagnosed depression was 4.6%. Individuals with hepatic steatosis showed less favorable metabolic profiles, including higher rates of diabetes and elevated liver enzyme levels. Those with depression were older, predominantly female, and had lower socioeconomic status. After fully adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that non-obese hepatic steatosis was significantly associated with an increased risk of depression, and obese hepatic steatosis was significantly associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study suggests a significant association between depression and hepatic steatosis with and without obese status. Given the significant impact of hepatic steatosis on depression outcomes, healthcare providers should screen patients with hepatic steatosis for depression and provide appropriate treatment as needed.",2025,[],[]
Mice harboring the obesity-associated SNP rs1421085 exhibit increased body weight and reveal an IRX3 neuronal circuit regulating body weight.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1421085 has one of the highest associated risks with obesity of any SNP in the human genome. Through the generation of a novel mouse model harboring rs1421085 (OA-SNP<sup>rs142/rs142</sup>), we examined the impact of this SNP on energy balance. Furthermore, we investigated the role of IRX3, a potential mediator of the metabolic effects of rs1421085, in multiple brain regions.<h4>Methods</h4>To explore the impact and mechanisms of rs1421085, we monitored body weight, food intake, energy expenditure, and other metabolic parameters of OA-SNP<sup>rs142/rs142</sup> mice under metabolic conditions similar to human obesogenic conditions (thermoneutral housing and 45% high fat diet). We additionally leveraged this model to investigate the impact of rs1421085 on genes that have been suggested to mediate the effects of this SNP on obesity. Finally, we used Irx3-Cre mice in combination with Cre-dependent AAV-Irx3 to determine if localized induction of IRX3 in neurons was sufficient to drive the energetic effects of rs1421085.<h4>Results</h4>OA-SNP<sup>rs142/rs142</sup> mice are more susceptible to diet-induced obesity and have increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure under human obesogenic conditions. Additionally, OA-SNP<sup>rs142/rs142</sup> mice have elevated Irx3 mRNA expression in the brain with prominent expression in metabolically relevant regions such as the posterior hypothalamus (PH) and dorsal vagal complex (DVC). Increased IRX3 in the PH, but not the DVC, resulted in a significant increase in body weight and food intake. Finally, we found that increased expression of IRX3, specifically in IRX3<sup>+</sup> neurons, decreases excitability and activity of IRX3<sup>+</sup> neurons in the PH but not the DVC. Interestingly, inhibition of IRX3<sup>+</sup> PH neurons led to increased body weight and food intake.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data demonstrate that OA-SNP<sup>rs142/rs142</sup> mice recapitulate the body weight phenotype associated with rs1421085 in humans and that increased IRX3 in the posterior hypothalamus, as seen in OA-SNP<sup>rs142/rs142</sup> mice, is sufficient to drive some of the metabolic effects of the SNP.",2025,"['irx3', 'irx3', 'a', 'irx3', 'irx3', 'irx3 mrna', 'irx3', 'irx3', 'irx3', 'irx3', 'irx3', 'oa - snp', 'r', 'irx3', 'oa - snp', 'r']",['irx3']

Prevalence of pre-clinical and clinical obesity in adults: Pooled analysis of 56 population-based national health surveys.,"Obesity is commonly defined using body mass index (BMI), but BMI alone does not capture the metabolic and functional consequences of excess weight. We examined the prevalence of clinical obesity, a new definition that incorporates BMI alongside metabolic and functional impairments. We analyzed nationally representative surveys. Clinical obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and waist-to-height ratio ≥0.5 or BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 with at least: self-reported diabetes, fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl, self-reported hypertension, blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, or total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dl. We estimated the survey-weighted and age-standardized prevalence of clinical obesity and BMI-only obesity by country and sex. Data from 56 countries were included (n = 142,250). The prevalence of clinical obesity ranged between 0% and 29%. The prevalence of clinical obesity was < 10% in 41 countries for men and 30 for women. In men, the largest shift in prevalence of BMI-only obesity and clinical obesity was observed in Malawi (0.7% vs 0.2%, relative change: -68%); in women, the largest shifts in prevalence were seen in Malawi (5.6% vs. 2.6%, relative change: -53%) and Rwanda (2.7% vs. 1.3%, relative change: -52%). The adoption of clinical obesity criteria revises obesity prevalence estimates and highlights metabolic and functional impairments beyond BMI. Our results emphasize the need to carefully consider how obesity is defined in population surveillance to ensure its relevance to health outcomes.",2025,[],[]
Association between obesity and Bell's palsy by combining Mendelian randomization and network pharmacology.,"<h4>Background</h4>The issue of obesity has emerged as a significant global health challenge; nevertheless, the association between Bell's palsy (BP) and obesity remains ambiguous. In this study, the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was employed to investigate their relationship, while network pharmacology methods were utilized to unveil the underlying mechanisms.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms closely linked to obesity and BP as instrumental variables for the MR analysis. Four robust bidirectional MR analysis methods, namely inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Egger were employed to assess the association between obesity and BP. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate levels of heterogeneity, sensitivity, and stability. Furthermore, we identified therapeutic targets associated with obesity and BP. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction network analysis was conducted. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were employed to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and BP.<h4>Results</h4>The IVW analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between obesity and BP (odds ratio [OR] = 1.267, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.049-1.530, P = .013). However, there was no evidence to suggest that BP increased the risk of obesity. Furthermore, network pharmacology analysis revealed that the 2 diseases shared a total of 712 common targets. GO enrichment analysis shows that this process mainly regulates chemical synaptic signal transmission by modulating receptor signaling factor activity, receptor ligand activity, etc. KEGG enrichment analysis shows that the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a significant role in this process.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study findings suggest that obesity may increase the risk of BP, and its underlying mechanism may potentially involve regulating chemical synaptic transmission through the EFGR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",2025,"['egfr', 'pi3k', 'akt', 'efgr', 'pi3k', 'akt']","['egfr', 'pi3k', 'akt']"
"Correlation of the differential expressions of RANK, RANKL, and OPG with obesity in the elderly population in Xinjiang.","<h4>Objective</h4>Obesity has been recognized as a global epidemic and public health crisis. The prevalence of obesity has tripled since 1975, especially in the elderly population. Accumulating preclinical and clinical studies have confirmed that chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissues is mechanistically related to metabolic diseases and tissue complications in overweight and obesity patients, as a result of the intricate interplay of various pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling cascades. The present study aims to explore the differential expressions of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in leukocytes of elderly obesity patients in Xinjiang, thereby providing new physiological, cellular, and molecular targets for the treatment of obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 40 obesity patients and 40 non-obesity patients were selected. The protein and gene expression levels of RANK, RANKL, and OPG in peripheral blood were detected by western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR.<h4>Results</h4>There was no significant difference in the expression levels of RANK protein, OPG protein, and OPG gene between the obesity group and non-obesity group (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The relative expression levels of the RANK gene and RANKL protein and gene were significantly different between the obesity group and non-obesity group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The differential expressions of the RANK gene, RANKL protein and gene, and the OPG protein in leukocytes had a significant correlation with obesity in the elderly population (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The expressions of the RANKL protein and gene and RANK gene in leukocytes of elderly obesity patients in Xinjiang were higher than those of non-obesity patients.

Systematic functional characterization of non-coding regulatory SNPs associated with central obesity.,"Central obesity is associated with higher risk of developing a wide range of diseases independent of overall obesity. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 300 susceptibility loci associated with central obesity. However, the functional understanding of these loci is limited by the fact that most loci are in non-coding regions. To address this issue, our study first prioritized 2,034 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation analysis. Subsequently, we employed self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to systematically evaluate the enhancer activity of these prioritized SNPs. The resulting data analysis identified 141 SNPs with allelic enhancer activity. Further analysis of allelic transcription factor (TF) binding prioritized 20 key TFs mediating the central-obesity-relevant genetic regulatory network. Finally, as an example, we illustrate the molecular mechanisms of how rs8079062 acts as an allele-specific enhancer to regulate the expression of its targeted RNF157. We also evaluated the role of RNF157 in the adipogenic differentiation process. In conclusion, our results provide an important resource for understanding the genetic regulatory mechanisms underlying central obesity.",2025,"['allelic transcription factor', 'tf', 'rn', 'rnf', '##7']",['rnf']
Distinct gut microbiota signatures in older people with sarcopenic obesity and sarcopenia without obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Previous evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis plays an important role in the development and progression of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (SO), but evidence supporting this association is lacking. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the characteristics of gut microbiota in older people with sarcopenia and SO.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 1558 older adults (age ≥65 years) from a community-based cohort in Shanghai, China, underwent sarcopenia screening using the SARC-F questionnaire, with 351 participants completing further assessment. On the basis of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 and the World Health Organization obesity criteria, 60 participants were categorized into three groups: SO (n = 20), sarcopenia without obesity (Sar, n = 18), and controls (Con, n = 22). Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4 regions).<h4>Results</h4>Significant differences in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were observed in the Sar and SO groups. A reduction in alpha diversity (Chao1 and ACE indices) was found in the SO group. Beta diversity based on unweighted Unifrac PCoA was significantly different among the three groups. LEfSe analysis identified 39 taxa with significant differential abundances across groups. The Sar group exhibited enrichment of Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Odoribacter, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Hungatella, Family_XIII_AD3011_group, Anaerotruncus, Ruminiclostridium, and Oxalobacter, along with their high taxonomic classifications. Meanwhile, Enterobacteriaceae, Allisonella, and Peptoclostridium were enriched in the SO group. Feature selection via Boruta algorithm identified five and four discriminatory taxa to construct random forest models, effectively distinguishing individuals with Sar and SO from Con. Key predictors for Sar included reduced Enterococcus, Enterobacter, and Hungatella and increased Odoribacter and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. Conversely, SO was characterized by decreased Enterobacter, Alloprevotella, and Enterococcus and increased Allisonella. Five-fold cross-validation confirmed robust diagnostic efficacy, achieving AUCs of 0.860 (95 % CI: 0.786-0.996) for Sar and 0.826 (95 % CI: 0.735-0.970) for SO.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrated that the gut microbiota of SO and Sar have distinct diversity and composition profiles. The results provide new insights into the role of gut microbiota in SO, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in this condition.",2025,[],[]
Time to Target Anti-Xa Level in Obese Vs Nonobese Patients Using an Adjusted Body Weight Heparin Infusion Protocol for the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism.,"<h4>Background</h4>Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a first-line option for the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Weight-based dosing protocols have demonstrated a decreased time to therapeutic anticoagulation, however, there are limited data on their utilization in obese patients, including the type of weight used.<h4>Objective</h4>The purpose of this study was to determine equivalency in time to reach target antifactor-Xa (anti-Xa) for obese and nonobese patients using the same adjusted body weight (AdjBW)-based UFH infusion protocol.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a single-center retrospective study of patients aged 18 years or older receiving an infusion of UFH for the treatment of VTE. The primary outcome was the median time to first target anti-Xa. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of first anti-Xa levels at 6 hours that were within, below, or above the target range and the median time to the second consecutive anti-Xa level within the target range. The safety outcome of evidence of major bleed was also evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 166 patients assessed (75 obese and 91 nonobese), there was no observed difference in median time to first target anti-Xa in obese vs nonobese patients when using an AdjBW UFH protocol (12.45 vs 13.03 hours, <i>P</i> = 0.49). The percentage of patients achieving a target anti-Xa at first evaluation did not differ between obese and nonobese groups (32.0% vs 34.07%, <i>P</i> = 0.78). A total of 14 patients across groups experienced evidence of major bleed, with no observed difference between obese and nonobese groups (8.00% vs 8.89%, <i>P</i> = 0.84).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>There was no observed difference in median time to first target anti-Xa in obese vs nonobese patients when using an AdjBW heparin infusion protocol, with no observed difference in evidence of major bleed. Our findings support the use of AdjBW in weight-based UFH dosing.",2025,"['antifactor - xa', 'anti - xa', 'anti - xa', 'anti - xa', 'anti - xa', 'anti - xa', 'anti - xa', 'anti - xa']",[]
Is orbital adipose tissue obesity-privileged? The relationship between small adipocyte size and metabolically healthy state from the view of orbital fat.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>White adipose tissue (WAT) expands by increasing adipocyte size (hypertrophy) and/or number (hyperplasia) to handle excess energy and plays a key homeostatic role in lipid metabolism. Hypertrophic adipocytes have many impaired biological functions. In contrast, hyperplastic adipocytes can reduce the negative metabolic effects of obesity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of adaptive WAT expansion is essential for optimizing lipid storage and preventing the adverse metabolic consequences of obesity. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been shown to improve adipose health and can be a pharmacological target to ameliorate obesity-induced metabolic abnormalities. Clinically, we found that the size of adipocytes in orbital fat (OF) is less affected by obesity, and we hypothesized that OF possesses a relatively metabolically healthy profile.<h4>Methods</h4>To verify our hypothesis, we identified multiple hallmarks of healthy adipose tissue in OF using a combination of bioinformatics-based transcriptomics analyses and experimental methods.<h4>Results</h4>Our results revealed that compared with abdominal subcutaneous fat (SF), OF had a smaller cell size, more dynamic ability to remodel the adipose extracellular matrix (ECM), higher vascular supply, and less macrophage infiltration. OF also showed promising adipogenic and proliferative capabilities and a healthy adipocytokine secretion pattern. Moreover, the Hh signaling was activated in OF and may influence depot-specific adipose health.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These findings collectively support that OF is generally in a naturally metabolically healthy state with high expandability and obesity-free privilege, providing new therapeutic ideas for obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions.",2025,"['hedgehog', 'h', 'hh']",['hedgehog']
Racial Health Disparity and Risk of Multiple Myeloma: Implications for Energy Balance Interventions.,"Established risk factors for multiple myeloma, including obesity and sedentary lifestyles, are associated with well-known racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk. This review examines established risk determinants for multiple myeloma in Black adults, summarizes evidence linking lifestyle factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, and diet, to disease risk, and discusses energy balance interventions, including cultural tailoring, to mitigate multiple myeloma risk. We summarize current evidence for racial/ethnic disparities in risk factors for multiple myeloma, including unmodifiable heritable factors, modifiable contributors to obesity, including diet and physical activity, and barriers to meeting physical activity and healthful diet guidelines. With this evidence, we present considerations to research lifestyle interventions directed toward risk factors for multiple myeloma. Current foundational scientific evidence in energy balance interventions for cancer risk management is primarily supported in non-Hispanic White populations. Evidence for preventative exercise, diet, or lifestyle interventions for multiple myeloma among underrepresented populations is scarce. Research considerations are proposed to provide strategies utilizing community engagement, primary care education, and importantly, availability of exercise and dietary resources. The importance of tailoring exercise and dietary interventions is also underscored, in addition to generating clinical trial-based evidence to be equitable and beneficial for all populations.",2025,[],[]

Simulated Dosing Regimens of Subcutaneous Infliximab in Adults and Children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Exploring Switch and Initiation Strategies.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>An increasing number of patients in clinical practice are transitioning from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous (SC) dosing of infliximab. In this simulation study, we evaluated hypothetical dosing scenarios both for typical adults and adults with obesity and for children switching from steady-state IV to SC infliximab, as well as those initiating SC infliximab therapy.<h4>Methods</h4>By combining two previous published infliximab models, we were able to simulate both IV and SC dosing in adults and children. Various dosing regimens were simulated using a large virtual population. In each scenario, the distribution of trough concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated.<h4>Results</h4>Peak levels were higher after IV dosing compared with SC dosing, while trough levels were higher after SC dosing, leading to more stable infliximab levels over time. Overall exposure remained largely similar when switching from a standard IV to SC dosing regimen. Patients with a high body mass index and those on high-frequency IV dosing regimens of infliximab demonstrated reduced exposure when transitioned to the fixed SC dose. Paediatric patients exhibited higher exposure on the fixed SC dose. Simulation of SC induction schemes demonstrated early achievement of steady-state plasma levels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Infliximab exposure (AUC) remains largely similar when transitioning from standard IV to SC dosing. Current dosing regimens may not be optimal for patients with severe obesity, paediatric patients and patients on high-frequency infliximab regimens. These findings provide a foundation for future clinical research to refine SC infliximab dosing in these populations.",2025,"['in', '##b', 'in', 'in', 'infliximab', 'infliximab', 'in', 'in', 'in', '##imab', 'in', '##b']",['infliximab']
The Interplay Between Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes: Common Pathophysiological Mechanisms Contributing to Telomere Shortening.,"The worldwide prevalence of obesity continues to increase, representing a serious public health issue due to associated comorbidities. Obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), which shares similar pathophysiological mechanisms. In both conditions, oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal adipose tissue function, and senescence are observed, ultimately leading to insulin resistance. In both cases, hypertrophic adipose tissue is associated with telomere shortening. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying telomere shortening in obesity and diabetes may be crucial for deepening our understanding of these pathologies, with the ultimate aim of its translational implications. Several studies have shown that telomere shortening is present in patients with metabolic disorders, emphasizing its prognostic value for the onset and progression of these diseases. From this perspective, this article highlights the importance of telomere biology, which can aid in developing new therapeutic options for metabolic disorders.",2025,['insulin'],['insulin']
Impact of obesity on clinical outcomes of v-NOTES hysterectomy: a retrospective study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a global health challenge that complicates gynecological surgery. Vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (v-NOTES) offers a minimally invasive approach to total hysterectomy (TH), but its safety and efficacy in obese patients remain underexplored.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to assess the impact of obesity on the perioperative and clinical outcomes of v-NOTES hysterectomy, accounting for potential confounders.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study analyzed 211 patients who underwent v-NOTES TH between January 2021 and September 2024. Patients were categorized into two groups based on BMI: the control group (BMI < 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>n</i> = 112) and the obesity group (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>n</i> = 99). Intraoperative indicators and postoperative outcomes during hospitalization, including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, gastrointestinal recovery, hospital stay, and postoperative complications, were compared. A multivariable regression analysis was used to adjust for confounders. All patients were followed up during hospitalization and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively.<h4>Results</h4>Obese patients had significantly longer operative times (<i>β</i> = 39.2, <i>p</i> < 0.001), delayed gastrointestinal recovery (time to first flatus: <i>β</i> = 5.8, <i>p</i> = 0.018), and prolonged hospital stays (<i>β</i> = 1.3, <i>p</i> = 0.002). No significant differences were found in intraoperative blood loss, conversion rates, blood transfusion, postoperative complication rates, or total hospitalization costs (limited to the inpatient period; all <i>p</i> > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>v-NOTES hysterectomy is a safe and effective option for obese patients, with comparable complication rates to non-obese patients. However, obesity independently contributes to longer operative times and delayed recovery. Targeted perioperative strategies, particularly for improving gastrointestinal recovery, could enhance outcomes in this population.",2025,[],[]
Molecular mechanisms of naringin's high lipid-lowering activity: pancreatic lipase inhibition and fat accumulation reduction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Naringin, a natural flavonoid compound, has demonstrated potential anti-obesity effects by modulating lipid metabolism. Pancreatic lipase plays a critical role in lipid digestion and absorption, making it a key target for obesity management. This study investigated the inhibitory mechanism of naringin on pancreatic lipase through in vitro, in vivo, and in silico experiments.<h4>Results</h4>In vitro experiments revealed that naringin was a competitive inhibitor of pancreatic lipase, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of 6.93 ± 0.12 mmol/L. Multi-fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that naringin induced secondary structure changes and static fluorescence quenching of pancreatic lipase, with a binding constant of 2.16 × 10<sup>4</sup> L/mol. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated a spontaneous exothermic reaction (-26.08 kJ/mol), mainly driven by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic force. In vivo studies demonstrated that naringin decreased serum lipase activity by 24.54%, mitigated hepatic lipid accumulation, and down-regulated inflammatory cytokines in high-fat diet-induced obese rats. Molecular simulation further revealed that hydrogen bonding was the primary interaction force between naringin and pancreatic lipase.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Naringin effectively inhibits pancreatic lipase through competitive binding and structural modifications, reducing lipid digestion and absorption. The inhibitory effect of naringin on pancreatic lipase might provide new insights into the role of naringin in lipid metabolism regulation and potential application in obesity management. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",2025,"['pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'serum lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase']",['pancreatic lipase']
Excessive mitochondrial fission and associated extracellular mitochondria mediate cardiac dysfunction in obesity cardiomyopathy.,"<h4>Aims</h4>Obesity cardiomyopathy (OCM) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by altered mitochondrial dynamics. Extracellular mitochondria (exMito) are released following tissue injury under various conditions. While the excessive mitochondrial fission-mediated release of exMito as a mechanism for mitochondrial quality control in several inflammatory disorders, its role in OCM remains unclear. The present work aimed to determine if excessive mitochondrial fission and associated exMito mediate the chronic inflammatory response and cardiac remodeling in OCM.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were treated with 200 μM palmitate (PA) to induce lipotoxicity. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce OCM. P110, a peptide inhibitor of Drp1/Fis1 interaction, was used to evaluate the impact of excessive mitochondrial fission on cardiac mitochondrial function, quality, and quantity of exMito, systemic inflammatory response, and cardiac contractile function in both models of OCM.<h4>Key findings</h4>PA induced excessive mitochondrial fission, increased oxidative stress, decreased ATP level, and damaged exMito release in vitro. Exposure of naïve cardiomyoblasts to exMito isolated from PA treated cells resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and a pro-inflammatory response. In vivo, HFD induced cardiac mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction, exMito release, and a pro-inflammatory response. Inhibition of Drp1/Fis1 interaction with P110 attenuated the observed effects both in vitro and in vivo.<h4>Significance</h4>P110 limited lipid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased exMito release, subsequently improving the inflammatory state and contractile function in our OCM model. Drp1/Fis1 dependent fission and associated exMito release might serve as a therapeutic target for obesity induced cardiomyopathy.",2025,"['p110', 'drp1', 'fis1', 'drp1', 'fis1', 'p110', 'p110', 'drp1', 'fis1']","['p110', 'drp1', 'fis1']"
Dietary Flavonoids Vitexin and Isovitexin: New Insights into Their Functional Roles in Human Health and Disease Prevention.,"Vitexin and isovitexin are dietary flavonoids widely distributed in food and medicinal plants. They have attracted increasing attention owing to their diverse pharmacological activities and favorable safety profiles. These compounds exhibit therapeutic potential across multiple biological systems, including the immune, nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems, through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, and neuroprotective mechanisms. Although previous reviews have addressed the pharmacological effects of vitexin and isovitexin, most are limited in scope-either focusing solely on vitexin or restricted to specific disease models such as cancer or diabetes. Moreover, some studies are outdated and do not reflect the recent advances in synthetic modification, green extraction technologies, and systems pharmacology. This review aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacological properties, pharmacokinetics, and clinical relevance of vitexin and isovitexin, highlighting their potential in disease prevention and treatment. A literature search was conducted using Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar, with keywords including ""vitexin"", ""isovitexin"", ""disease"", and ""mechanism"". Here, we summarize the current research on the pharmacological effects of vitexin and isovitexin in metabolic disorders, inflammatory diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative conditions, focusing on their molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we discussed their toxicity, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical research findings. Vitexin and isovitexin hold promise as therapeutic agents or adjuncts for multiple diseases with potential applications in modern medicine and healthcare. However, their pharmacological mechanisms, clinical efficacy, and potential synergistic effects with other therapeutic agents remain unclear.

Targeting Metabolic Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease: The Role of GLP-1 Agonists in Body Weight Regulation and Neuroprotection.,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>This review explores the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in addressing metabolic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), focusing on body weight regulation and neuroprotection.<h4>Recent findings</h4>GLP-1 RAs modulate insulin signaling, reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and improve mitochondrial functional mechanisms linked to neuroprotection. Clinical trials show modest but sustained improvements in motor symptoms and suggest benefits in cognition, mood, and apathy. While GLP-1 RAs induce weight loss in diabetes, their metabolic impact in normoglycaemic PD patients appears limited. However, individuals with obesity or insulin resistance may experience enhanced clinical and cognitive outcomes. GLP-1 RAs offer a multifaceted therapeutic strategy in PD, targeting both central neurodegenerative processes and peripheral metabolic dysfunction. Their potential for disease modification and symptom relief, particularly in specific phenotypes, supports their further exploration as part of a personalized treatment approach.",2025,"['glp - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1 ras', 'insulin', 'glp - 1 ras', 'insulin', 'glp - 1 ras']","['glp 1 receptor', 'insulin']"
Cardio-cerebrovascular disease risk factors among male night-shift workers in South Korea: a comparative analysis of drivers and security guards.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study investigates the prevalence of cardio-cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) risk factors among male night-shift workers in South Korea, focusing on drivers and security guards, who constitute a significant portion of the older worker population.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Using data from the 2016 nationwide workers' special health examination, the authors analyzed health habits, past illnesses, and body measurements related to CCVDs among male drivers (N = 8862) and security guards (N = 7156) in their 60s.<h4>Results</h4>The age of the drivers and security guards were mean ± standard deviation 63.19±2.62 years and 64.93±2.72 years, respectively. The drivers exhibit unhealthier lifestyle habits and a higher prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity compared to security guards. Additionally, drivers have unhealthier body measurement values and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.844, 95% CI: 1.722-1.974, p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings underscore the heightened risk of CCVD among drivers compared to security guards among older night-shift workers in South Korea, highlighting the need for tailored health policies for this demographic.

Effects of Eight Weeks of Aerobic Training Combined with Carbohydrate Mouth Rinse on Body Composition and Exercise Performance in Adult Men with Obesity: Evidence from Korea.,"<b>Background:</b> Considering that the prevalence of obesity has risen rapidly in recent decades, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a carbohydrate mouth rinse (CMR) on the outcomes of aerobic training among adult men with obesity, focusing particularly on the effects of repeated use on body composition and exercise performance. <b>Methods:</b> The intervention targeted 20 men with obesity in their 20s and 30s randomly assigned to either a CMR group (n = 10) or a placebo mouth rinse (PMR) group (n = 10). Both groups completed treadmill-based aerobic training three times per week for eight weeks. Prior to each session, participants used a mouth rinse at 60, 40, and 20 s before the start of each exercise, holding either a 6% maltodextrin solution (CMR) or purified water (PMR) in their mouths for 5 to 10 s before expectorating. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included body composition (body weight and body fat percentage), resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), and exercise performance (rate of perceived exertion [RPE], exercise distance, speed, and time). Data were analyzed using 2 × 2 repeated measures analysis of variance. <b>Results:</b> Following the intervention, the CMR group showed significantly greater improvements than the PMR group did in body fat percentage, RMR, VO<sub>2</sub>max, exercise distance, speed, and time (<i>p</i> < 0.01). However, the interaction effect for RPE was not statistically significant between the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.175). Overall, the repeated use of the CMR during aerobic training contributed to enhanced exercise performance and favorable physiological changes without additional caloric intake. <b>Conclusions:</b> A CMR may be a practical and non-caloric ergogenic aid to support exercise performance and metabolic function in individuals with obesity. Its repeated use during aerobic training appears to be effective and safe, especially when fasting while exercising, when improving endurance without compromising fat loss is essential.",2025,[],[]
Exploring glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists as potential disease-modifying agents in autoimmune diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are emerging with therapeutic agents for the treatment of two of the most prevalent metabolic disorders: diabetes and obesity. However, the causal relationship between GLP-1R agonists and autoimmune diseases is still unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>The available cis-eQTLs for drug target genes (GLP-1Rs) were used as proxies for exposure to GLP-1R agonists. Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were used as positive controls to ensure the reliability of the genetic instrument. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to reveal the causal association of genetic proxy GLP-1R agonists with 18 autoimmune diseases from the IEU OpenGwas database and FinnGen database. Finally, the results of the two databases were analyzed via meta-analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 22 significant cis-eQTL single-nucleotide polymorphisms were included as genetic instruments. Positive control analysis revealed that GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with obesity (OR = 0.826, p = 0.021) and T2DM (OR = 0.886, p < 0.001), which is consistent with the meta-analysis. MR analysis revealed that increased expression of the GLP-1R gene has a significant protective effect on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), hypothyroidism, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the MR analysis suggested that increased expression of GLP-1R agonists may increase the risk of Graves' disease (GD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and psoriasis. Our findings were consistent with those of the meta-analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides new insights into potential adjuvant treatments for autoimmune diseases from the perspective of genetic variation and provides evidence for the safety of GLP-1R agonists.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1rs', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r gene', 'glp - 1r', 'glp - 1r']",['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor']
The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a narrative review of current evidence and future directions.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have transformed obesity management, offering substantial weight loss and metabolic benefits. This review examines their expanding role, evaluating efficacy compared to alternative treatments, emerging indications, ongoing challenges, and future directions. Beyond obesity and type 2 diabetes, the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 RAs extends to a range of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, neurodegenerative disease, and substance abuse disorders. While early concerns regarding pancreatic and thyroid cancer have been largely attenuated by recent evidence, issues such as gallbladder and biliary disorders, psychiatric safety, and perioperative aspiration risk require ongoing investigation. Additionally, observations of weight regain after treatment discontinuation and reductions in lean mass highlight the need for long-term, individualized strategies to sustain clinical benefits. The high cost and limited access to these medications raise critical policy and equity challenges. Future research must address these gaps, focusing on long-term safety, optimizing combination approaches, and evaluating the broader clinical and economic implications of widespread GLP-1 RA use.<h4>Funding</h4>K.B.F. is supported by a William Dawson Scholar award from McGill University.

Long-acting PYY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;-36&lt;/sub&gt; analogue with semaglutide for obesity: from preclinical assessment through randomized clinical studies.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The hormone peptide YY (PYY; cleaved into Y<sub>2</sub>-selective form PYY<sub>3-36</sub>) is an attractive candidate for use as a complementary pharmacotherapy for obesity along with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. This series of studies investigated a novel long-acting PYY<sub>3-36</sub> analogue (PYY1875) alone and as an add-on to semaglutide for treatment of obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Weight loss and food intake were first investigated in obese male rats, followed by phase 1 and 2 clinical studies investigating efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PYY1875 as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide in participants with overweight or obesity.<h4>Results</h4>PYY1875 induced additional body weight loss in semaglutide-treated obese rats. In the phase 1 study, all doses of PYY1875 alone and coadministered with semaglutide were tolerated. In the phase 2 study, a modest but not clinically meaningful treatment effect of PYY1875 1.0 mg versus placebo as an add-on to semaglutide 2.4 mg was observed. However, gastrointestinal-related adverse events were common with the 1.0-mg PYY1875 dose, and the 2.0-mg PYY1875 dose escalation regimen was not tolerated (both as add-ons to semaglutide).<h4>Conclusions</h4>PYY1875 showed modest efficacy as an add-on to semaglutide for weight management in people with obesity, but the treatment was not well tolerated.",2025,"['y', 'p', 'p', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) receptor', 'p', '##y', '3', 'p', 'p', 'p']",[]
Sirtuin 1 overexpression in mice preserves insulin and thermogenic responses in subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue under proinflammatory conditions.,"Activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or subcutaneous adipose tissue (iWAT in mice) is a strategy to regulate metabolic homeostasis. The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays an essential role in energy metabolism and inflammation and is a promising target to tackle obesity and associated comorbidities. We have previously reported the beneficial effect of moderate SIRT1 overexpression in protecting mice against inflammation-induced insulin resistance and impaired BAT thermogenesis. Here, we investigated the effect of an inflammatory environment on insulin sensitivity and thermogenic capacity in iWAT from wild-type (WT) or SIRT1 overexpressing mice (Sirt1<sup>Tg+</sup>). We also analyzed in vitro responses to insulin and norepinephrine (NE) in subcutaneous white adipocytes (iWA) from both genotypes under proinflammatory conditions. Results showed higher UCP-1 levels in iWAT from Sirt1<sup>Tg+</sup> mice under thermoneutral conditions compared to WT mice, an effect also found in vitro in differentiated iWA. Cold-induced UCP-1 expression and insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation levels were reduced in iWAT from WT mice upon in vivo bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. However, these reductions were attenuated in iWAT from Sirt1<sup>Tg+</sup> mice. Likewise, in iWA exposed to the conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 macrophages (CM-LPS) both insulin signaling and NE-induced UCP-1 expression levels were preserved only in cells overexpressing SIRT1. LPS or CM-LPS increased SIRT1 levels in iWAT or iWA, respectively, an effect more evident upon SIRT1 overexpression. Collectively, our results suggest a SIRT1-dependent anti-inflammatory compensatory response that likely protects iWAT from the deleterious effects of inflammation.",2025,"['iwat', 'deacetylase', 'sirtuin 1', 'sirt1', 'sirt1', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'iwat', 'sirt1', 'sirt1', 'insulin', 'ucp - 1', 'iwat', 'sirt1', 'iwa', 'ucp - 1', 'insulin', 'akt', 'iwat', 'iwat', 'sirt1', 'iwa', 'insulin', 'ne', 'ucp - 1', 'sirt1', 'sirt1', 'iwat', 'iwa', 'sirt1', 'sirt1', 'iwat']","['sirtuin 1', 'sirt1', 'insulin', 'ucp 1', 'akt']"
Gut Microbiota Shifts After a Weight Loss Program in Adults with Obesity: The WLM3P Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a key modulator in obesity management, influencing host energy balance, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory pathways. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise globally, dietary interventions that promote beneficial microbial shifts are essential for enhancing weight loss outcomes and long-term health.<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigated the effects of the multicomponent Weight Loss Maintenance 3 Phases Program (WLM3P), which integrates caloric restriction, a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet, time-restricted eating (10h TRE), dietary supplementation (prebiotics and phytochemicals), and digital app-based support on gut microbiota composition compared to a standard low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) in adults with obesity. The analysis focused exclusively on the 6-month weight loss period corresponding to Phases 1 and 2 of the WLM3P intervention.<h4>Methods</h4>In this sub-analysis of a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04192357), 58 adults with obesity (BMI 30.0-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomized to the WLM3P (<i>n</i> = 29) or LCD (<i>n</i> = 29) groups. Stool samples were collected at baseline and 6 months for 16S rRNA sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity were assessed, and genus-level differential abundance was determined using EdgeR and LEfSe. Associations between microbial taxa and clinical outcomes were evaluated using regression models.<h4>Results</h4>After 6-month, the WLM3P group showed a significant increase in alpha diversity (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and a significant change in beta diversity (<i>p</i> < 0.01), while no significant changes were observed in the LCD group. Differential abundance analysis revealed specific microbial signatures in WLM3P participants, including increased levels of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>. Notably, higher <i>Faecalibacterium</i> abundance was associated with greater reductions in fat mass (kg, %) and visceral adiposity (cm<sup>2</sup>) in the WLM3P group compared to LCD (<i>p</i> < 0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings suggest a potential microbiota-mediated mechanism in weight loss, where <i>Faecalibacterium</i> may enhance fat reduction effectiveness in the context of the WLM3P intervention.",2025,['16s rrna'],['16s rrna']
Effective anesthesia management for super obesity-related compartment syndrome with ultrasound and Doppler guidance: A different strategy.,"Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) arises from increased pressure within a confined osteofascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia, metabolic deficits, and potential irreversible damage if untreated. Although trauma is the most common cause, obesity-especially when combined with immobility-can increase the risk of ACS, presenting significant challenges in anesthetic management. This case report details the anesthesiological management of a 42-year-old man with severe obesity (BMI 78 kg/m²), classified as super-super obese, who presented with ACS in his right lower limb. Given his complex airway and the limitations of performing general anesthesia (GA), a regional anesthetic approach was selected. Due to anatomical challenges posed by the patient's obesity, an adductor canal block was performed using ultrasound and Doppler guidance to identify key structures and achieve a successful block. The patient was sedated, remained hemodynamically stable during surgery, and required minimal analgesics postoperatively. This case highlights the critical role of regional anesthesia in super obese patients, overcoming challenges like difficult anatomical landmarks and limited equipment, and underscores the importance of personalized, adaptive approaches to achieve optimal outcomes. Despite the technical difficulties, this successful use of regional anesthesia provides valuable insights into the management of high-risk super obese patients with ACS and reinforces the need for anesthesiologists to employ creative and flexible techniques, including advanced imaging tools, to ensure safe anesthesia care.",2025,[],[]
Gut microbiota in sexual function: exploring new avenues.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The gut microbiota, which is recognized for its crucial role in regulating numerous physiological processes, harbors a relationship with sexual function that has remained relatively understudied.<h4>Objectives</h4>This narrative review aims to integrate the existing evidence regarding the association between the gut microbiota and sexual function. Additionally, it endeavors to discuss the research challenges and delineate the future directions within this burgeoning field.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive analysis was carried out on both pre-clinical and clinical studies. The scope of the analysis encompassed: (1) the associations between the composition of the gut microbiota and various forms of sexual dysfunctions, (2) the risk factors for sexual dysfunction that are associated with alterations in the microbiota, and (3) the potential interventions that target the regulation of the gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>In the context of erectile dysfunction and hypoactive sexual desire disorder, several investigations have identified specific changes in the gut microbiota. Additionally, risk factors for sexual dysfunction, such as mental health disorders, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid dysfunction, are also influenced by the gut microbiota. Promising intervention strategies include dietary modification, supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and bioengineering approaches.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current body of evidence has established a link between gut microbial dysbiosis and the pathophysiology of various sexual health issues. Despite the fact that our understanding and assessment of the impact of gut microbes on the sexual function of the host are still in their infancy, continued advancements may unveil novel potential targets for the management of sexual health.",2025,[],[]
Determining patient eligibility for a physical activity referral scheme through EHR data extraction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Physical Activity Referral Schemes (PARS) are an effective treatment option for promoting physical activity and positively impacting patient care. Retrospective evaluation of PARS implementation requires identifying the eligible patient population that was reached. However, during a clinic visit, health care providers (HCPs) may decide that a physical activity referral is not appropriate for various reasons, such as acute illness or recent surgical history. Including patient visits with these health conditions in assessing a PARS may lead to an overestimation of patients eligible for referral.<h4>Objective</h4>To develop a process that more accurately determines patient eligibility for a physical activity referral when retrospectively extracting patient visit data from the electronic health record (EHR).<h4>Methods</h4>Inclusion criteria were developed to identify patient visits potentially eligible for a physical activity referral based on five chronic conditions. These conditions were highlighted during the standardized training that staff received when implementing the PARS. Development of exclusion criteria incorporated exercise contraindications from published literature, input from practicing HCPs, and refinement by a multidisciplinary healthcare team. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were pooled and mapped to International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, codes and applied to EHR data.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 334 referrals (numerator) were identified from the pool of eligible patient visits meeting the inclusion criteria. In calculating the denominator for our reach estimate, 479,536 patient visits were initially extracted from the EHR. Applying the inclusion criteria, 58% of these visits were PARS-eligible (n = 277,515). The eligible visits further decreased by 23% (n = 63,203) with the application of the exclusion criteria, leaving a total of 214,312 PARS-eligible visits (denominator), a 55% reduction from the initial number of total patient visits.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Through this multi-step process, we developed a novel approach for retrospectively identifying patient visits eligible for a physical activity referral that can be applied to extracted EHR data for subsequent evaluation. This process can be used by other healthcare systems and researchers in the assessment of PARS. Ongoing refinement of the exclusion criteria is needed to best reflect the eligible population and provide the most accurate estimate of the overall PARS reach.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>Not applicable.",2025,[],[]

Elevated Contact Stresses Compromise Activity-Mediated Cartilage Rehydration but not Lubrication.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Understanding how obesity-a key risk factor for osteoarthritis-effects articular cartilage function is critical to understand OA pathoetiology. Cartilage, a biphasic material, supports vanishingly low friction coefficients in vivo, but is tribomechanically compromised by load-induced interstitial pressure/lubrication loss. To maintain tribomechanical function, cartilage must recover fluid lost to habitual/average contact stresses, a problem obesity likely exacerbates. Recently, we have shown that articulation/sliding drives robust interstitial fluid recovery and indefinite maintenance of biofidelic tissue strains and frictions through generation of hydrodynamic pressures within cartilage contact interfaces, i.e., via 'tribological rehydration.' However, the impact of elevated contact stresses on tribological rehydration and cartilage's function/lubrication remains unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>Using our convergent stationary contact area (cSCA) testing approach on ovine stifle cartilage explants bathed in PBS, we aimed to elucidate several points: (1) the effect of elevated contact stress on tribological rehydration during high-speed articulation, and how (2) cartilage material properties and (3) sliding speed influence contact stress-dependent fluid exudation, rehydration, and lubrication.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, we identified that (i) contact stress, across a narrow range, and (ii) static loading time are key controllers of tribological rehydration magnitude, compression accumulation, and equilibrium/total compression under biofidelic cSCA loading and sliding conditions. However, over the range tested (i.e., 0.2-0.8 MPa), (iii) contact stresses had no appreciable effect on cartilage's remarkable lubricity in the cSCA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results show that obesity is likely to directly physically impair articular cartilage function, and that obesity-driven tissue compression/strain, and not friction per se, may be the primary mechanical driver of cartilage dysfunction and OA risk.",2025,[],[]
Role of Enzyme Technologies and Applied Enzymology in Valorising Seaweed Bioproducts.,"Seaweeds, classified as non-vascular plants, have definite advantages over terrestrial plants as they grow rapidly, can be cultivated in coastal environments, and are dependable and non-endangered sources of biomass. Algal bioproducts, which include a wide range of bioactive compounds, have drawn much interest because of their applications in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and cosmetics. Particularly in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields, algal bioproducts have shown tremendous activity in regulating enzymes involved in human diseases. However, the drawbacks of conventional extraction methods impede the complete exploitation of seaweed biomass. These include low efficiency, high cost, and potential harm to the environment. Enzyme technology developments in recent years present a viable way to overcome these challenges. Enzymatic processes improve product yields and reduce the environmental impact of processing, while facilitating the more effective extraction of valuable bioactive compounds as part of an integrated biorefinery approach. Enzyme-assisted biorefinery techniques can greatly advance the creation of a circular bioeconomy and increase the yield of extracted seaweed bioproducts, thus improving their value. With the potential to scale up to industrial levels, these biotechnological developments in enzymatic extraction are developing rapidly and can advance the sustainable exploitation of seaweed resources.

Combining kinetics and in silico approaches to evaluate bromhexine as an anti-pancreatic lipase agent for obesity management.,"Industrialization, fast food intake and reduced physical activity, mainly in developed countries, exacerbate obesity and make it a major lifestyle disorder. A promising strategy for developing effective anti-obesity agents is to inhibit pancreatic lipase, thereby reducing lipid absorption. Currently, the only clinically approved pharmacological agent for pancreatic lipase inhibition is Orlistat. However, its undesirable gastrointestinal side effects have prompted the search for more effective and potent drugs. This study investigates the inhibitory mechanism of Bromhexine, a mucolytic drug, on pancreatic lipase using Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis and molecular docking, along with simulations, and compares its efficacy to that of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug Orlistat. Kinetic analysis indicates that Bromhexine exhibits mixed inhibition of pancreatic lipase, with IC<sub>50</sub> and K<sub>i</sub> values of 360 µM and 450 µM, respectively, which are comparable to those of Orlistat. Molecular docking confirms that Bromhexine interacts with the His263 residue in the enzyme's active site through hydrogen bonding, similar to Orlistat, thereby reducing the enzyme's affinity for its natural substrate. Binding pose metadynamics (BPMD) simulations further supports the stability of Bromhexine's interactions. Collectively, our findings suggest that Bromhexine displays potent pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibition activity and could serve as a potential candidate in weight management as demonstrated by both in silico and in vitro analyses. However, further investigations, including structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses and in vivo studies, are necessary to confirm its clinical potential as a pancreatic lipase inhibitor.",2025,"['pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pancreatic lipase', 'pl', '##creatic lipase']",['pancreatic lipase']
The Critical Role of Body Composition Assessment in Advancing Research and Clinical Health Risk Assessment across the Lifespan.,"Obesity and low muscle mass are major public health concerns, especially in older adults, due to their strong links to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality. Beyond body mass index, body composition metrics including skeletal muscle, fat mass, and visceral adipose tissue offer deeper insights into nutrition and disease risk. These measures are essential for both cross-sectional assessments and longitudinal tracking, providing a clearer picture of health changes over time. Selecting body composition assessment tools requires balancing cost, practicality, accuracy, and data quality. The right tools enhance research, refine clinical assessments, and inform targeted interventions. Aligning methods with specific research or clinical goals improves disease risk stratification and advances personalized treatments. This review highlights the importance of integrating body composition assessment into research and clinical practice, addressing knowledge gaps across diverse populations and emphasizing its potential in advancing precision medicine. It also highlights recent advancements in body composition assessment techniques that warrant consideration when evaluating techniques for a specific application. Future efforts should focus on refining these tools, expanding their accessibility, and developing comprehensive risk models that incorporate body composition alongside behavioral, environmental, and genetic factors to improve disease prediction and prevention strategies.",2025,[],[]

"Sleep and Cardiometabolic Health: A Narrative Review of Epidemiological Evidence, Mechanisms, and Interventions.","<h4>Background</h4>Short or poor-quality sleep can disrupt glucose metabolism, blood pressure regulation, appetite hormones, and inflammatory pathways, potentially accelerating weight gain, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. However, this multidimensional role of sleep in cardiometabolic disease prevention and management remains underappreciated. Existing literature has not fully synthesized how various aspects of sleep influence the spectrum of cardiometabolic conditions, nor how improving sleep might confer health benefits.<h4>Objective</h4>This narrative review examines epidemiological evidence linking sleep health to cardiometabolic outcomes, elucidates biological mechanisms underlying these associations, and discusses interventions aimed at optimizing sleep for cardiometabolic benefit.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched and reviewed recent studies and meta-analyses on sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and circadian disruption in relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality.<h4>Findings</h4>Abnormal sleep patterns are consistently associated with elevated risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Habitual short sleep predicts higher incidence of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, while chronic insomnia is linked to 45% greater odds of developing or dying from cardiovascular disease. Conversely, healthy sleep-typically 7-9 hours of regular, high-quality sleep per night-is associated with favorable cardiometabolic profiles and has been added to public health cardiovascular metrics. Mechanistically, inadequate sleep provokes insulin resistance, sympathetic overactivity, hormonal appetite changes, and systemic inflammation, which synergistically promote cardiometabolic disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Prioritizing healthy sleep habits and treating sleep disorders should become integral to lifestyle medicine for cardiometabolic health. Emerging intervention trials suggest that extending sleep or treating OSA can modestly improve weight control, glycemic regulation, and blood pressure.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin']",['insulin']
Inhibitory Effects and the Potential Mechanism of Phloretin on Animal Fatty Acid Synthase.,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a critical enzyme involved in lipid biosynthesis, is highly expressed in adipocytes and exhibits aberrant activity in diverse human cancers. Phloretin, a natural dihydrochalcone abundant in apple peels, crabapples, strawberries, and pears, has emerged as a potential modulator of FASN activity. This study investigates phloretin's inhibitory effects on FASN and the underlying mechanisms. Biochemical assays revealed that phloretin inhibited FASN in a dose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 4.90 ± 0.66 μM. Kinetic analysis demonstrated distinct inhibition patterns: competitive inhibition against acetyl-CoA, mixed competitive/noncompetitive inhibition toward malonyl-CoA, and uncompetitive inhibition relative to NADPH. Molecular docking simulations further indicated that phloretin binds to the β-ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain of FASN, suggesting a mechanism distinct from that of typical flavonoid inhibitors. Notably, phloretin exhibited irreversible inhibition of FASN, in contrast with the inhibition observed for other flavonoids. To validate the cellular relevance, we demonstrated that phloretin suppressed FASN expression and enzymatic activity in breast cancer cells, concomitant with significant reductions in intracellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation and cancer cell viability. Although adipocytes were not studied in this work due to the long differentiation period required, future studies are planned to investigate FASN inhibition in adipogenesis models. Given FASN's dual role as a therapeutic target in obesity and oncogenesis, these findings highlight phloretin's translational potential as a multitarget agent for metabolic and neoplastic disorders. The well-characterized inhibition mechanism of phloretin, combined with its dual capacity to suppress lipogenesis and inhibit proliferation, establishes this natural compound as a compelling candidate for advanced preclinical evaluation in therapeutics for metabolic disorders.",2025,"['fatty acid synthase', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'β - ketoacyl synthase', 'ks', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'phloretin', 'phloretin']","['fatty acid synthase', 'fasn', 'phloretin']"
Impact of physical activity and BMI on health-related quality of life in overweight Indian adolescents: A randomized controlled study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a critical yet often overlooked component of adolescent obesity management. While physical activity (PA) and body mass index (BMI) are established markers of health, their combined influence on HRQOL in Indian adolescents remains underexplored.<h4>Objective</h4>To examine how PA and BMI influence overall and domain-specific HRQOL in overweight and adolescents with obesity following a structured lifestyle program.<h4>Methods</h4>In this randomized controlled study, 604 adolescents (aged 11-16 years) with BMI above the 85th percentile were recruited from schools in Udupi, India. Individuals were randomized into three groups: multifactorial strategy (MFI: exercise, lifestyle education, behavioral counseling), exercise-only (EX), and Control group (CON). PA was measured using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A), and HRQOL was measured via the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0). Linear mixed-effects models evaluated associations between PA, BMI, and HRQOL over a 12-month period, which included a 12-week intervention followed by 9 months of follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>PA was linked with better HRQOL in the MFI (β = 9.30, p < 0.001) and EX (β = 4.47, p < 0.001) groups. Interestingly, higher BMI correlated with better HRQOL scores in both program arms. The CON group showed no meaningful association between PA and HRQOL. The domain-level analysis found that PA and BMI were positively linked to physical, emotional, social, and school functioning in both program groups, with more pronounced effects in the MFI group. The CON group showed improvement only in emotional functioning related to BMI.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Structured PA programs, especially those combining education and behavioral support, notably enhance the quality of life among overweight Indian adolescents. These findings reinforce the importance of focusing not solely on weight loss, but on holistic, behavior-driven health outcomes in adolescent obesity care.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>CTRI/2019/04/018,834.",2025,[],[]
"Sarcopenic obesity in the Asia-Pacific region: Epidemiology, risk factors, and management.","Sarcopenic obesity (SO), characterized by the concurrent presence of sarcopenia and obesity, is an emerging public health challenge in the Asia-Pacific region. With rapid population aging and increasing obesity rates, the prevalence of SO is increasing, particularly among individuals over 60 years of age. This condition results from a complex interplay of muscle loss, fat accumulation, chronic inflammation, hormonal changes, and metabolic dysregulation, leading to heightened risks of frailty, disability, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Region-specific risk factors, including dietary transitions, reduced physical activity, and socioeconomic disparities, further contribute to its increasing prevalence. While pharmacological options are under investigation, lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of prevention and management. Regular resistance training, adequate protein intake, and balanced nutrition are essential for preserving muscle mass while promoting fat reduction. Community-based interventions, such as structured exercise programs, public health campaigns, and urban planning that encourage active aging, are crucial for sustainable long-term outcomes. The current inconsistency in diagnostic criteria has led to numerous challenges, highlighting the urgent need for consensus. In addition, targeted policies focusing on nutritional education, elderly friendly infrastructure, and access to preventive healthcare are essential to alleviating the burden of SO. A comprehensive approach that integrates lifestyle interventions, clinical advancements, and supportive policies is crucial for effectively addressing the growing impact of SO in the Asia-Pacific region and improving health outcomes for the aging population.",2025,[],[]
The Impact of Nutritional Knowledge of Mothers on Their Children's Nutritional Knowledge and Weight Status.,"<b>Objectives:</b> This cross-sectional study assessed the nutritional knowledge of Saudi mothers and their children. Then, it examined the association between the nutritional knowledge of mothers and the nutritional knowledge and weight status of their schoolchildren in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. <b>Methods:</b> The mothers' nutritional knowledge was assessed using the validated Arabic version of the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ). The children's nutritional knowledge was assessed through an interviewer-administered questionnaire, and their weight status was determined based on their Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-score, which was calculated according to their anthropometric measurements. <b>Results:</b> One hundred children and sixty mothers were included in this study. Only 6.67% of the mothers had a high level of nutrition knowledge. A total of 54% of their children had low nutritional knowledge scores, and approximately 27% was classified as having excess weight. More than 40% of the children reported consuming fruits and vegetables 4-5 times/week, whereas 50% of the children consumed fast foods 1-3 times/week. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that higher nutritional knowledge scores among the children were significantly associated with higher mothers' knowledge scores [(0.06 (95%CI: 0.0.03, 0.0.08)] and older age among these children [0.61 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.77)], as the older children had higher knowledge scores. The children's nutritional knowledge, however, was not associated with the child's sex, mothers' age, or mothers' education. The maternal knowledge scores were not associated with the child's weight status. <b>Conclusions:</b> Given that the nutrition knowledge scores of Saudi mothers are significantly associated with those of their children, but not with their weight status, it can be concluded that nutrition knowledge alone may not be sufficient to address the overweight and obesity epidemic in Saudi Arabia. However, it remains a crucial component of multifaceted interventions that also enhance physical activity and promote behavior change to improve health outcomes and weight status in the Saudi population.",2025,[],[]

Discovery of Hypoglycemic and Cardiovascular Drugs as Effective Inhibitors on Human Pancreatic Lipase.,"Obesity is closely related to the occurrence and development of many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. As an important digestive enzyme, human pancreatic lipase (hPL) is involved in the metabolism and absorption of dietary fat and is a key target of overweight and obesity. Therefore, the inhibition of hPL enzyme is a feasible strategy for the prevention and treatment of obesity. In this study, we collected a series of marketed hypoglycemic and cardiovascular drugs and evaluated their inhibitory activity against hPL. Among them, ticagrelor (HC-14), prasugrel (HC-18), amlodipine (HC-26), simvastatin (HC-32), and lovastatin (HC-33) had strong inhibitory activity against hPL. In order to further clarify the inhibition mechanism, inhibition kinetics and molecular docking were carried out, and results revealed that HC-14 was a mixed inhibitory manner on hPL activity. HC-14 also showed similar inhibitory effect on human carboxylesterase 2 (hCES2), but poor inhibitory effect on other five serine hydrolases. Further studies showed that HC-14 significantly inhibited hPL activity in AR42J cells, resulting in dose-dependent inhibition. Overall, the above results suggest that ticagrelor is a cardiovascular drug that inhibits hPL, which also provides an important reference for the search and development of other drugs for the treatment of obesity.",2025,"['human pancreatic lipase', 'hpl', 'hpl enzyme', '##l', 'hpl', 'hpl', 'human carboxylesterase 2', 'hces2', 'serine hydrolase', 'hc - 14', 'hpl', 'hpl']",['hpl']

The Mechanisms of Chronic Inflammation in Obesity and Potential Therapeutic Strategies: A Narrative Review.,"Obesity, a global health concern of increasing significance, is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation (LGCI) that significantly contributes to metabolic dysfunction. This narrative review explores the intricate pathophysiological mechanisms driving LGCI in obesity, emphasizing the role of adipose tissue, immune cell activation, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Hypertrophic adipocytes and infiltrating immune cells, particularly macrophages, release a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation. These mediators disrupt insulin signaling through JNK and NF-κB pathway activation, leading to systemic insulin resistance, cardiovascular complications, gut dysbiosis and other metabolic disorders. The review further discusses therapeutic strategies to mitigate obesity-related LGCI, focusing on lifestyle interventions, nutritional approaches, and pharmacological agents. Physical activity, specific nutrients, and dietary patterns can modulate inflammatory responses, while anti-obesogenic medicines and bariatric procedures offer additional avenues for intervention. By understanding and addressing the root causes of inflammation in obesity, healthcare professionals can develop targeted strategies to improve metabolic health and overall well-being of individuals with obesity and, ultimately, prevent and manage the wide-ranging complications associated with this condition.",2025,"['tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'il - 1β', 'insulin', 'jnk', 'nf - κb', 'insulin']","['insulin', 'jnk']"
Intravenous Iron Infusion in the Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anaemia Following Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery and Correlation with Gynaecological Disorders: Retrospective Review of Experience from a Tertiary Centre.,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common consequence of bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS). Women are at higher risk, and some patients cannot tolerate oral iron. This study aimed to report the demographics of patients with IDA that required iron infusion post-BMS and to investigate risk factors including gynaecological dysfunction. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The medical records for all patients (<i>n</i> = 383) post-BMS at a large tertiary centre from January 2017 to December 2024 were reviewed, and those who received intravenous iron infusion (<i>n</i> = 32) for IDA were included. The criteria for iron infusion were ferritin < 50 µg/L or intolerance to oral iron. Demographic information including co-morbidities-gynaecological and other-age, pre-operative weight, body mass index (BMI), and ferritin levels were collected to investigate possible risk factors for IDA. <i>Results</i>: Thirty-two patients, all female, received one or more parenteral iron infusions. Eighteen had surgery locally; 14 had surgery elsewhere. Operations varied and included 14 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses, 14 sleeve gastrectomy's, and 4 gastric bands or other procedures. Eleven patients had a history of gynaecological disorders. Pre-infusion ferritin levels in the cohort with gynaecological disorders versus the cohort without were lower (median 11.0 vs. 14.5 µg/L), with a shorter time to presentation (median 6.9 vs. 10.2 years), and more patients requiring >2 infusions for resolution of symptoms (36.4% vs. 9.5%). <i>Conclusions</i>: Locally, 95% of our patients did not require iron infusion post-BMS. Eighty percent of those who did require iron infusion responded to ≤2 infusions. Women with a history of gynaecological disorder who underwent BMS required a significantly higher number of iron infusions and presented with symptoms sooner post-operatively vs. those without gynaecological disorders, particularly following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This is an important observation to consider both pre- and post-operatively for patients undergoing bariatric surgery, and additional well-designed studies that investigate this further are needed.",2025,"['ferritin', 'ferritin', 'ferritin']",['ferritin']
Associations Between Paternal Body Mass Index and Neurodevelopmental-Physical Outcomes in Small-for-Gestational-Age Children.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study investigated the association between paternal preconception paternal body mass index (BMI) categories and physical/neurodevelopmental outcomes in Chinese small-for-gestational-age (SGA) children. <b>Methods</b>: A prospective cohort study enrolled 412 singleton SGA infants born at Peking University People's Hospital in 2020-2022. Fathers were stratified into underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups. Follow-up assessments at 24-36 months evaluated growth parameters weight, height, BMI Z-scores and neurodevelopment using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) and ASQ: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE). Multivariable regression was adjusted for paternal covariates. <b>Results:</b> In SGA offspring, paternal underweight correlated with lower birth weights vs. normal/obese paternal BMI and the highest severe SGA rates. Prospective monitoring identified elevated BMI Z-scores (ΔZ = +0.40) and 8.7-fold heightened obesity risk in the paternal obesity group versus normal-weight counterparts. Neurodevelopmental evaluations demonstrated gross motor impairments in both underweight (ΔZ = -0.22) and obese paternal subgroups (ΔZ = -0.25) compared with the normal-weight group, with the obesity cohort additionally exhibiting problem-solving deficiencies (ΔZ = -0.19). The paternal obesity group manifested three-fold greater likelihood of social-emotional delays than the normal-weight group. The underweight and obese paternal groups showed 3.46-fold and 2.73-fold higher probabilities of gross motor deficits, respectively, while obesity was linked to 3.27-fold elevated problem-solving impairment risk-all comparisons versus normal paternal BMI. Overweight status showed no significant links to growth or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Normal-weight fathers had lower risks of obesity and neurodevelopmental issues. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study revealed U-shaped paternal BMI-neurodevelopment links in SGA offspring. Paternal obesity raised offspring obesity/neurodevelopmental risks, while underweight linked to severe SGA and motor deficits, highlighting paternal weight optimization's modifiable role.",2025,[],[]
Obesity-Related Kidney Disease: A Growing Threat to Renal Health.,"Obesity represents a serious and growing disease worldwide. The pathophysiological changes secondary to chronic inflammation lead to the development of diseases that increase the morbidity and mortality of individuals. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition with deleterious effects that acts bidirectionally with obesity. From approximately 20% to 30% of individuals share phenotypes of CKD and obesity, increasing their cardiovascular risk and the risk of other complications. Obesity and CKD form a vicious cycle in which inflammation is the central axis of multiorgan damage. Despite increasing the risk of cardiac and renal mortality, CKD progresses in relation to body mass index and albuminuria.

Obesity- and High-Fat-Diet-Induced Neuroinflammation: Implications for Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction and Endothelial Disorders.,"Obesity is a multifactorial condition linked to severe health complications, including cardiovascular diseases and endothelial dysfunction. Both obesity and high-fat diets (HFDs) are strongly associated with neuroinflammation, particularly in the hypothalamus. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), which controls involuntary physiological processes, is critical for maintaining cardiovascular health, and its dysfunction is implicated in endothelial disorders. With its homeostatic control centers located in the hypothalamus and brainstem, a crucial question arises: could obesity- and HFD-induced neuroinflammation disrupt central ANS structures, leading to ANS dysfunction and subsequent endothelial disorders? This review examined whether neuroinflammation caused by obesity and HFD contributes to endothelial dysfunction through the dysregulation of the ANS. Our analysis revealed that hypothalamic inflammation linked to obesity and an HFD is associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and endothelial disorders. Identified molecular mechanisms include the influence of inflammatory cytokines, activation of the NF-κB/IKK-β pathway, microglial activation mediated by angiotensin II, circulating mitochondria triggering cGAS activation, and the stimulation of the TLR4 pathway. Our findings suggest that hypothalamic inflammation may play a central role in the interplay between obesity/an HFD, ANS dysfunction, and endothelial disorders.",2025,"['nf - κb', 'ikk - β', 'angiotensin ii', 'cgas', 't']","['angiotensin ii', 'cgas']"
Blood glucose trajectories in diabetes patients receiving CAPDCA model of personalised patient education: A cluster randomised controlled trial.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The CAPDCA (Collection, Assessment, Plan, Do, Check, Aggrandisement) Model is a structured and individualised health education framework designed for dynamic adjustment and continuous improvement. This study evaluated its efficacy in diabetes management.<h4>Methods</h4>A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted across 6 community health centres, involving 178 patients with type 2 diabetes. The intervention group (n = 90) received CAPDCA model education, while the control group (n = 88) received traditional education. The intervention spanned 18 months, with HbA1c collected at baseline and study end. Blood glucose was collected at each follow-up. Analysis used Group-Based Trajectory Model (GBTM).<h4>Results</h4>Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed: lower HbA1c (t = 6.356, p < 0.01) and greater HbA1c reduction (t = -6.117, p < 0.01). GBTM revealed distinct glucose trajectories: FBG had two trajectories (Steady descent group and rebound group). The 2 h-PG had three trajectories (High BG-high descent group, Medium BG-low descent group, and low BG-high descent group). All trajectories demonstrated that blood glucose levels reached clinically target ranges post-intervention. Baseline HbA1c influenced FBG trajectories, while baseline HbA1c and medication adherence influenced 2 h-PG trajectories. Age, gender, education, and disease duration showed no significant association with trajectories.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The CAPDCA model can effectively improve the control of HbA1c. The analysis of influencing factors of different trajectories suggested that the model was suitable for patients with different ages, genders, education levels, and disease duration. Further studies would be needed in exploring the application to various diseases and integrating the CAPDCA model with technologies such as artificial intelligence.",2025,"['hba1', 'hba1c', 'h', 'h']","['hba1', 'hba1c']"

Leptin in colorectal cancer: literature review.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The aim of this review was to review and summarize the current evidence regarding the expression and role of leptin and its receptor (LEPR) in colorectal cancer (CRC). This includes discussing their involvement in carcinogenesis, progression, and prognosis, as well as assessing their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.<h4>Content</h4>We conducted a scoping literature review using several databases. We included studies in English or French that analyzed the expression of leptin and LEPR in the serum or tissue of CRC patients. Additionally, the GEPIA2 platform was employed to investigate the association between leptin and LEPR expression levels and overall survival, as well as their expression across pathological stages and microsatellite subtypes in CRC.<h4>Summary</h4>A total of 76 eligible studies published between 1994 and 2024 were included. Analyses through immunohistochemical methods, transcriptomics, and serum measurements indicated elevated expression of leptin and LEPR in CRC. However, findings regarding their prognostic value varied: some studies reported a link between high leptin and LEPR levels and poor prognosis, while others found no correlation or even suggested favorable outcomes. This variability in results can be attributed to differences in methodology, patient diversity, and genetic polymorphisms.<h4>Outlook</h4>The leptin-LEPR system seems to play a significant role in the development and progression of CRC, but its exact prognostic impact remains uncertain due to inconsistent findings. Further standardized and large-scale studies are necessary to clarify its clinical relevance. The leptin-LEPR axis shows promise as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target, particularly in the context of obesity-related CRC.",2025,"['leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'lepr', 'leptin', 'lepr']","['leptin', 'lepr']"
Clinical Practice Consensus Statement 2025: Management of Hyperuricemia and Gout in Adolescents.,"<h4>Background</h4>In response to the increasing global prevalence of gout, there is a concerning shift towards a younger demographic, with China at the forefront of this trend. Hyperuricemia, a central factor in the pathogenesis of gout, is becoming increasingly common among adolescents, particularly males, and is associated with various health risks, including joint pain, CKD, metabolic disorders, and premature death. Despite the seriousness of this issue, there is a lack of specific guidelines addressing adolescent and hyperuricemia gout management.<h4>Methods</h4>The working comprising 26 clinician pediatricians, rheumatologists, and endocrinologists, all experienced in the clinical presentation and management of gout and hyperuricemia, was convened to develop a consensus. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE published from 1 January 1960 to 31 May 2024. Two rounds of Delphi surveys for each recommendation were conducted among all group members via electronic questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>Adolescent-onset gout is characterized by a pronounced genetic predisposition and distinct environmental influences, with a significant number of cases reporting a positive family history.

The Body Roundness Index (BRI) is a new obesity indicator based on the eccentricity theory and combined with height and waist circumference, which reflects the level of visceral fat more accurately than traditional indicators. However, its association with stroke remains unclear. This study aims to compare the associations of the BRI and body mass index (BMI) with stroke and its prognosis.<h4>Methods</h4>The data of 29,745 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2018 were analyzed. Based on weighted logistic regression, weighted COX regression, and restricted cubic spline, the associations of BRI and BMI with the odds of stroke and the risk of all-cause mortality were analyzed; the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and concordance index were used to evaluate the performance of BRI and BMI in predicting stroke and Survival outcome.<h4>Results</h4>After adjusting for all confounding factors, weighted logistic regression and weighted Cox regression respectively showed that both BRI (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.10, P = 0.004) and BMI (OR: 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.03, P = 0.03) were independently and positively associated with stroke. Meanwhile, both BRI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91, 95%CI 0.86-0.98, P = 0.01) and BMI (HR: 0.95, 95%CI 0.92-0.97, P < 0.0001) significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality among stroke survivors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of BRI for predicting stroke was 0.62, while that of BMI was 0.545, and the difference between the two was significant (P<sub>DeLong</sub> < 0.001). The time-dependent c-index curve demonstrated that BRI and BMI had comparable abilities to predict the risk of all-cause mortality among stroke survivors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Both the BRI and the BMI have verified the obesity and stroke paradox. BRI and the BMI are significantly positively correlated with stroke, and the BRI has a stronger ability to predict stroke than the BMI; however, both the BRI and the BMI are significantly negatively correlated with the prognosis of stroke survivors and have comparable predictive abilities.",2025,[],[]
Type 2 diabetes mediated heart failure: focus on early recognition and clinical strategies.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for the development of heart failure (HF), both directly by impairing cardiac function and indirectly through related conditions such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, renal dysfunction, and other metabolic disorders. The prevention of T2DM-related HF is a comprehensive management process involving complex and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. An in-depth exploration of the pathophysiological and clinical risk factors of HF in T2DM can assist clinicians in identifying individuals at high risk of HF, enabling early intervention measures to prevent its onset. In this review, we present data on the pathophysiology and epidemiology of T2DM-mediated HF, clinical phenotypic features of cardiomyopathy, and summarize clinical risk factors predicting HF development identified in multiple studies, risk assessment tools, and clinical trial data on the efficacy of lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, and bariatric surgical interventions. Finally, we discuss best practice recommendations for clinicians, highlight potential limitations and challenges, and propose possible future research directions.",2025,[],[]
Ameliorative Effect of Heat-Killed &lt;i&gt;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&lt;/i&gt; Q1 (LPQ1) on Lipid Accumulation: Integration of Network Pharmacology with &lt;i&gt;In Vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Vivo&lt;/i&gt; Experiments.,"Lipid metabolism disorders are expanding at an alarming rate worldwide pressuring the entire healthcare system. Therefore, exploring effective therapeutic treatments for lipid metabolism disorders is a hot spot in research. The therapeutic effects of paraprobiotics on obesity are still not fully explored through the integration of network pharmacology analysis with in vitro and in vivo experiments to confirm their beneficial effect. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of heat-killed <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> Q1 (LPQ1) on lipid accumulation through the integration of network pharmacology analysis with in vitro and in vivo experiments. Findings of network pharmacology analysis conform with <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments, revealing that the modulating effect of LPQ1 on lipid metabolism was effective through the regulation of PPAR-γ and TNF-α expression. Therefore, LPQ1 can be promoted as an effective therapeutic agent against lipid metabolism disorders owing to its modulatory effect on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation.",2025,"['lpq1', 'lpq1', 'ppar - γ', 'tnf - α', 'lpq1']",[]
Hepatic AhR Activation by TCDD Induces Obesity and Steatosis via Hepatic Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).,"Exposure to persistent organic pollutants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) increases metabolic disorder risk. In this study, we show that a single intraperitoneal injection of TCDD (10 μg/kg) in C57BL/6J mice induced body weight gain, lipid accumulation in the liver and adipose tissue, macrophage infiltration, and elevated hepatic and serum triglyceride levels after 12 weeks. Despite serum aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand levels normalizing by 12 weeks, the persistent effects suggest TCDD sequestration in fat tissue. TCDD inhibited the expression of mitochondrial proteins (COX1, TOM20, TFAM, H2AX) and reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Liver-specific AhR knockout ameliorated TCDD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, and macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, TCDD-induced hepatic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoted adipocyte hypertrophy. In the liver, PAI-1 disrupted the interaction between tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB), thereby enhancing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly. These findings reveal that hepatocyte-derived circulating PAI-1, upregulated via hepatic AhR activation, contributes to adipocyte hypertrophy and hepatosteatosis through the intracellular modulation of the tPA-PAI-1 axis. Thus, hepatic AhR activation drives mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity, even after a single TCDD exposure.",2025,"['aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'ahr', 'cox1', 'tom20', 'tfam', 'h2ax', 'liver - specific ahr', 'hepatic plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1', 'pai - 1', 'pai - 1', 'tissue - type plasminogen activator', 'tpa', 'apolipoprotein b', 'apob', 'very - low - density lipoprotein', 'vldl', 'pai - 1', 'hepatic ahr', 'tpa', 'pai - 1', 'he', '##patic ahr']","['aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'ahr', 'cox1', 'tom20', 'tfam', 'h2ax', 'tissue type plasminogen activator', 'tpa', 'apolipoprotein b', 'apob', 'very low density lipoprotein', 'vldl']"
Impact of Incretin-Based Therapy on Skeletal Muscle Health.,"Skeletal muscle is the largest insulin-sensitive tissue in the human body, playing a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, body mobility and overall metabolic health. In obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), skeletal muscle undergoes structural, functional, and metabolic alterations, including reduced muscle mass, impaired contractile function, increased myosteatosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Incretin-based therapies such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) or dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RAs are highly effective treatments for T2D and obesity, producing substantial weight loss. While clinical trials suggest proportional loss of fat and lean mass when using incretin-based therapies, emerging preclinical and translational data indicate potential muscle-specific beneficial effects such as attenuation of atrophy, improved myogenesis, enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced myosteatosis. This review comprehensively summarizes the current preclinical and clinical evidence on the impact of incretin-based therapies on skeletal muscle mass, composition, metabolism, and performance, focusing on mechanistic insights from animal models and translational findings from human studies.",2025,"['insulin', 'in', 'glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor', 'glp - 1 ras', 'glp - 1', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide', 'gip', 'in', 'in']","['insulin', 'glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'glp 1', 'gip']"
Granzyme B PET Imaging Predicts Response to Immunotherapy in a Diet-Induced Obesity Model of Breast Cancer.,"The effects of obesity on cancer treatment efficacy remain unclear, as both beneficial and detrimental modulations of the tumor immune microenvironment have been reported. We compared <sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP (βAla-Gly-Gly-Ile-Glu-Phe-Asp-CHO) PET images with those obtained with the gold standard, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET, to quantify biologic variations in a diet-induced obesity model of triple-negative breast cancer to understand how obesity influences the tumor immune landscape and response to immunotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> C57BL6/J mice were fed a high-fat diet (<i>n</i> = 24) or low-fat diet (<i>n</i> = 18) for 14 wk. EO771 tumor-bearing mice were treated with a fixed or weight-based dose of saline or checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy, and tumor volume was evaluated for long-term response. Mice were imaged via <sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP PET on day 7 to quantify immune activation, and those images were compared with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET images to characterize changes in glucose metabolism on days 0 and 6.

No significant differences were observed in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG SUV for responder tumors on day 6. The <sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP PET signal was increased in tumors responsive to immunotherapy on day 7 and was highly sensitive in predicting response via analysis of receiver-operating-characteristic curves. <b>Conclusion:</b> Obesity decreases response to immunotherapy by altering metabolism and the tumor immune microenvironment. <sup>68</sup>Ga-NOTA-GZP PET imaging is a sensitive and predictive imaging biomarker of immunotherapy response, but weight-based dosing is needed to achieve effective changes in tumor volume.",2025,[],[]
Treating Childhood Obesity: Building and Evaluating Evidence-Based Models of Integrated Care.,"Childhood obesity is a complex chronic condition, such that effective management requires intensive programming and sustained access to treatment. Integrated care models are useful for designing and delivering services to treat children with overweight or obesity. For this narrative mini-review, we searched PubMed (January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2024) using broad terms in 3 categories-care models, condition of interest (obesity), and population of interest (children/youth). This resulted in identification of 2 foundational models, the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and the Patient/Family-Centered Medical Home (PFCMH), which distinguish key elements of integrated care for childhood obesity (treatment with self-management support, team-based care, child/family activation and engagement, collaborative community linkages, and care coordination) and considerations for implementing such models (accessibility to care, virtual care, interprofessional education, and information systems and clinical decision support). Drawing upon the CCM and PFCMH, we designed an integrated care model with the child/family at the center and coordinated wraparound services pertaining to sectors influencing child health (health care, community, and family home). We concluded by noting the need to further study, adapt, scale, and fund strategies for implementing integrated care models and underscoring the importance of relevant outcome measures to drive ongoing quality improvement and sustainability.",2025,[],[]
BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in macrophages regulates obesity-induced adipose tissue metaflammation.,"Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are key cellular components that respond to nutritional excess, contributing to obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying macrophage polarization and recruitment in adipose tissue during obesity remain unclear. In this study, we investigated mitophagy-dependent metabolic reprogramming in ATMs and identified a crucial role of the mitophagy receptor BNIP3 in regulating macrophage polarization in response to obesity. Mitophagic flux in ATMs increased following 12 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, with <i>Bnip3</i> levels upregulated in a HIF1A dependent manner, without affecting other mitophagy receptors. Macrophage-specific <i>bnip3</i> knockout reduced HFD-induced adipose tissue inflammation and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, hypoxic conditions <i>in vitro</i> induced HIF1A-BNIP3-mediated mitophagy and glycolytic shift in macrophages. Furthermore, HIF1A-BNIP3 signaling-enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory activation in macrophages. These findings demonstrate that BNIP3-mediated mitophagy regulates the glycolytic shift and pro-inflammatory polarization in macrophages and suggest that BNIP3 could be a therapeutical target for obesity-related metabolic diseases.<b>Abbreviation:</b> 2-DG: 2-deoxyglucose; ACADM/MCAD: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase medium chain; ADGRE1/F4/80: adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1; ATMs: adipose tissue macrophages; BNIP3: BCL2 interacting protein 3; BNIP3L/NIX: BCL2 interacting protein 3 like; CLS: crown-like structure; CoCl<sub>2</sub>: cobalt(II) chloride; COX4/COXIV: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4; ECAR: extracellular acidification rate; ECM: extraceullular matrix; gWAT: gonadal white adipose tissue; HFD: high-fat diet; HIF1A/HIF-1 α: hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha; IL1B/IL-1β: interleukin 1 beta; ITGAM/CD11B: integrin subunit alpha M; KO: knockout; LAMs: lipid-associated macrophages; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MRC1/CD206: mannose receptor C-type 1; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; NCD: normal chow diet; OCR: oxygen consumption rate; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; PINK1: PTEN induced kinase 1; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; PTPRC/CD45: protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C; SVFs: stromal vascular fractions; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TMRM: tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; TOMM20: Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; TREM2: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; WT: wild-type.",2025,"['insulin', 'mitophagy receptor bnip3', 'bnip3', 'hif1a', 'bnip3', 'insulin', 'hif1a', 'bnip3', 'hif1a', 'bnip3', 'bnip3', 'bnip3', 'acadm', 'mcad', 'acyl - coa dehydrogenase medium chain', 'adgre1', 'f4 / 80', 'adhesion g protein - coupled receptor e1', 'bnip3', 'bcl2 interacting protein 3', 'bnip3l', 'nix', 'bcl2 interacting protein 3 like', 'cox4', 'coxiv', 'cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4', 'ecar', 'ecm', 'h', 'hif1a', 'hif - 1 α', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha', 'il1b', 'il - 1β', 'interleukin 1 beta', 'itgam', 'cd11b', 'integrin subunit alpha m', 'lams', 'map1lc3', 'lc3', 'microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3', 'mrc1', 'cd206', 'mannose receptor c - type 1', 'n', '##d', 'o', '##r', 'pink1', 'pten induced kinase 1', 'prkn', 'parkin', 'parkin rb', 'e3 ubiquitin protein ligase', 'ptprc', 'cd45', 'protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type c', '##vfs', 'tem', 'tmrm', 'tomm20', 'translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20', 'trem2', 'triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2']","['insulin', 'bnip3', 'hif1a', 'acadm', 'mcad', 'adgre1', 'bcl2 interacting protein 3', 'bnip3l', 'nix', 'bcl2 interacting protein 3 like', 'cox4', 'coxiv', 'ecm', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha', 'il1b', 'interleukin 1 beta', 'itgam', 'cd11b', 'integrin subunit alpha m', 'lams', 'lc3', 'mrc1', 'cd206', 'pink1', 'pten induced kinase 1', 'prkn', 'parkin', 'ptprc', 'cd45', 'protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type c', 'tem', 'tomm20', 'translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20', 'trem2', 'triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2']"
Mediating Mendelian randomization in the proteome identified potential drug targets for obesity-related allergic asthma.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the development of the economy, the number of obese patients has been increasing annually worldwide. The proportion of asthma patients associated with obesity is also gradually rising. However, the pathogenesis of obesity-related asthma remains incompletely understood, and conventional pharmacological treatments generally show limited efficacy.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to explore the causal relationship between obesity and allergic asthma, elucidate the pathogenesis of obesity-related asthma, and identify the plasma proteins involved in its development, providing new insights for clinical interventions.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we employed a two-step approach for mediation Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, utilizing stringent selection criteria to identify instrumental variables (IVs). This approach was used to assess the causal impact of obesity on allergic asthma and to validate the plasma proteins identified as mediating factors. We further explored the functions and enriched pathways of the mediating proteins using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Finally, we conducted drug-targeted MR analysis to evaluate the potential of each mediator plasma proteins as a drug target gene. If significant heterogeneity remained among the IVs, we applied the weighted median method as the primary analytical tool. Otherwise, we utilized the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the main analytical approach. Additionally, we conducted various sensitivity analyses and statistical tests to further illustrate the robustness of the observed associations.<h4>Results</h4>The research findings indicate a causal relationship between obesity and allergic asthma. Plasma proteins such as TPST1, ROR1, and DAPK1 mediate this relationship, with TPST1 accounting for over 10% of the mediation effect. GO and KEGG analyses show that the genes corresponding to these mediator proteins are primarily enriched in pathways related to responses to stimuli, carbohydrate synthesis and metabolism, regulation of certain protein activities, and synaptic connections. The drug-targeted MR analysis suggests that SIGLEC12, BOLA1, HOMER2, and TPST1 all have the potential to be drug target genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study suggests that obese patients defined by BMI may promote the development of allergic asthma by influencing the expression of plasma proteins such as TPST1, ROR1, and DAPK1. Furthermore, some of these plasma proteins, including TPST1, could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for treating allergic asthma in these patients. However, further research is needed to explore their therapeutic potential and the mechanisms underlying their effects.<h4>Clinical trial number</h4>Not applicable.",2025,"['tpst1', 'ror1', 'dapk1', 'tpst1', 'siglec12', 'bola1', 'homer2', 'tpst1', 'tpst1', 'ror1', 'dapk1', 'tpst1']","['tpst1', 'ror1', 'dapk1', 'siglec12', 'bola1', 'homer2']"
"Vitamin D deficiency, supplementation, and colorectal cancer outcomes: interactions with obesity and risk profiles.","<h4>Background</h4>Vitamin D deficiency, colorectal cancer, and tumor progression are increasingly linked in recent research. Beyond its well-established roles in bone metabolism and immune regulation, vitamin D has emerged as a potential modulator of cancer prevention and prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer, where deficiency may worsen outcomes.<h4>Purpose</h4>Vitamin D is critical in the prevention and prognosis of colorectal cancer, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma. This review aims to explore the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on colorectal cancer progression and assess the role of vitamin D supplementation in improving outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A narrative review was conducted, utilizing five databases: PubMed, Medline Plus, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing on human studies published in the last 15 years (from 2012 to 2025). Priority was given to primary studies like randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, while systematic reviews were included for broader context. Exclusion criteria included animal studies, non-English papers, and non-peer-reviewed content.<h4>Results</h4>The review synthesizes evidence from 33 primary studies and 16 high-quality reviews. Findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation may enhance prognosis by influencing serum levels, immune modulation, and gut microbiota. However, clinical trials results are mixed, particularly concerning optimal dosing, genetic variability, and factors like obesity.<h4>Discussion</h4>Vitamin D supplementation shows promise in improving colorectal cancer prognosis, but further research is necessary to refine dosing strategies and develop personalized therapies tailored to individual patient needs.",2025,[],[]
A machine learning model for predicting obesity risk in patients with diabetes mellitus: analysis of NHANES 2007-2018.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a prevalent and clinically significant complication among individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), contributing to increased cardiovascular risk, metabolic burden, and reduced quality of life. Despite its high prevalence, the risk factors for obesity within this population remain incompletely understood. With the growing availability of large-scale health datasets and advancements in machine learning, there is an opportunity to improve risk stratification. This study aimed to identify key predictors of obesity and develop a machine learning-based predictive model for patients with T2DM using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).<h4>Methods</h4>Data from adults with diabetes were extracted from the NHANES 2007-2018 cycles. Participants were categorized into obese and non-obese groups based on BMI. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with 10-fold cross-validation was used to select relevant features. Subsequently, nine machine learning algorithms-including logistic regression, random forest (RF), radial support vector machine (RSVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, LightGBM, decision tree (DT), elastic net regression (ENet), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-were employed to construct predictive models. Model performance was evaluated based on area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was visualized using a nomogram to enhance clinical applicability.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3,794 participants with type 2 diabetes were included in the analysis, of whom 57.0% were classified as obese. LASSO regression identified 19 key variables associated with obesity. Among the nine machine learning models evaluated, the logistic regression model demonstrated the best overall performance, with the lowest Brier score. It also showed good discrimination (AUC = 0.751 in the training set and 0.781 in the test set), favorable calibration, and consistent clinical utility based on decision curve analysis (DCA). A nomogram was constructed based on the logistic regression model to facilitate individualized risk prediction, with total points corresponding to predicted probabilities of obesity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Obesity remains highly prevalent among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Our findings highlight key clinical features associated with obesity risk and provide a practical tool to aid in early identification and individualized management of high-risk patients.",2025,"['h', 'h']",[]
Visceral fat: the hidden culprit behind thoracolumbar surgery infections.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to explore the relationship between visceral fat area (VFA) and the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after thoracolumbar posterior surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,491 patients who had undergone posterior thoracolumbar surgery from January 1, 2022, through May 30, 2023. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, undergoing thoracolumbar posterior surgery, and having complete clinical data with a follow-up duration exceeding 1 year. Exclusion criteria included minimally invasive surgery, preoperative infections, traumatic skin injuries, combined tumors, and patients with long-term steroid use or immune system diseases. VFA was measured using CT scans, and patients were categorized based on VFA ≥100 cm<sup>2</sup> as having visceral fat obesity. The incidence of SSI was assessed according to the CDC criteria. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for SSI.<h4>Results</h4>The incidence of SSI was 2.4% (36 out of 1,491 patients). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that VFA was the most significant predictor of SSI [<i>P</i> < 0.001; Exp(B) = 1.026; 95% CI, 1.013-1.040], indicating a 2.6% increased infection risk per 1 cm<sup>2</sup> increase in VFA. Other significant risk factors included BMI [<i>P</i> = 0.024; Exp(B) = 1.138; 95% CI, 1.018-1.273]. Patients with visceral fat obesity had a significantly higher infection rate (5.7% vs. 1.2%, <i>P</i> < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>VFA is a significant risk factor for SSI following thoracolumbar posterior surgery.

Metabolomic Alterations in Patients with Obesity and the Impact of Metabolic Bariatric Surgery: Insights for Future Research.,"Metabolomics has emerged as a vital tool for understanding the body's responses to therapeutic interventions. Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) is widely recognized as the most effective treatment modality for severe obesity and its associated comorbidities. This review seeks to analyze the current evidence on the metabolomic profiles of patients with obesity and the impact of various bariatric surgical procedures, with the objective of predicting clinical outcomes, including weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The data gathered from original studies examining metabolomic changes following MBS have been meticulously compiled and summarized. The findings revealed significant alterations in metabolites across various classes, including amino acids, lipids, energy-related compounds, and substances derived from the gut microbiota. Notably, elevated preoperative levels of specific lipids, such as phospholipids, long-chain fatty acids, and bile acids, were correlated with postoperative remission of T2D. In conclusion, metabolite profiling holds great promise for predicting long-term responses to different bariatric surgery procedures. This innovative approach has the potential to facilitate personalized treatment strategies and optimize the allocation of healthcare resources.",2025,[],[]
Dopamine D2 Receptors and Its Downstream Signaling in Compulsive Eating.,"Obesity has become a major public health crisis and serves as an underlying condition for other chronic metabolic diseases. The dysregulation of the inhibitory and regulatory mechanisms of the mesolimbic dopamine system, particularly dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), plays a critical role in driving excessive food consumption and compulsive eating habits. Based on the current literature, chronic consumption of high-fat foods elicits hedonic sensations and has the potential to downregulate and desensitize D2Rs, impairing their signaling and inhibitory action. This impairment thereby alters the downstream signaling of the D2Rs, involving the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the associated cascade. Although individual components of this proposed pathway have been studied, a comprehensive synthesis has not been established. This review aims to explore the relationship between D2R downregulation and desensitization and their effects on the downstream signaling cascade. We hypothesize that alterations in this pathway may lead to the dysregulation of the expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides, contributing to binge-eating behaviors.",2025,"['dopamine d2 receptors', 'd2rs', 'd2rs', 'd2rs', 'adenylyl cyclase', 'd2r']","['dopamine d2 receptor', 'd2r', 'adenylyl cyclase']"
Heart failure and obesity: Translational approaches and therapeutic perspectives. A scientific statement of the Heart Failure Association of the ESC.,"Obesity and heart failure (HF) represent two growing pandemics. In the general population, obesity affects one in eight adults and is linked with an increased risk for HF. Obesity is even more common in patients with HF, where it complicates the diagnosis of HF and is linked with worse symptoms and impaired exercise capacity. Over the past few years, new evidence on the mechanisms linking obesity with HF has been reported, particularly in relation to HF with preserved ejection fraction. Novel therapies inducing weight loss appear to have favourable effects on health status and cardiovascular risk. Against the backdrop of this rapidly evolving evidence landscape, HF clinicians are increasingly required to tailor their preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches to HF in the presence of obesity. This scientific statement by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology provides an up-to-date summary on obesity in HF, covering key areas such as epidemiology, translational aspects, diagnostic challenges, therapeutic approaches, and trial design.",2025,[],[]
Prenatal maternal HFD exposure impairs cognition via a hippocampal NMDA mechanism.,"Maternal obesity increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairments in offspring later in life. Most animal studies investigated the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) from pre-mating to lactation on offspring neurodevelopment and cognitive function. However, the specific impact of in-utero exposure to maternal HFD on the cognitive function in offspring remains limited. In this study, female dams were fed laboratory chow or HFD for 11 weeks: 8 weeks before conception and during gestation. To isolate the prenatal effects, newborns were reared by foster mothers under control-diet conditions during lactation. Behavioral tests were conducted between postnatal days 42 and 56. Our results demonstrate that maternal HFD exposure in utero impaired spatial working memory and spatial memory, and also caused depression-like behavior in offspring. These behavioral abnormalities were associated with reduced hippocampal NMDA receptor expression, diminished neurogenesis, and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, intrahippocampal microinjection of NMDA receptor antagonists that block NMDA ion channels or compete for glutamate binding effectively reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, microinjection of NMDA into the hippocampus bilaterally activated NMDA receptor signaling, leading to the amelioration of behavioral abnormalities in HFD offspring. In summary, alteration of hippocampal NMDA receptors induced by prenatal maternal HFD exposure is associated with spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring.",2025,"['nmda receptor', 'nmda receptor', 'nmda', 'nmda', 'nmda receptor', 'hippocampal nmda receptors']","['nmda receptor', 'nmda']"
The effectiveness of school-based obesity prevention interventions on the health behaviours of children aged 6-18 years: A secondary data analysis of a systematic review.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Obesity remains a contributor to the burden of disease globally. Suboptimal diet and physical inactivity are two rising risk factors of obesity in youth; both are targeted for obesity prevention. Further, these risk behaviours cluster and may be associated with other risks including smoking and alcohol intake. Few studies, however, have examined the extent to which interventions targeting obesity also impact on other health behaviours. The aim of this study is to synthesise the effects of child obesity prevention programs on diet, physical activity, tobacco smoking and alcohol intake, and to investigate differential effects by interventions that target different behaviours.<h4>Methods</h4>A secondary data analysis of an existing systematic review was conducted. Literature searches identified any additional papers from 1990 to 2023 associated with the originally included studies. All papers were screened and were eligible if they reported any diet, physical activity, smoking or alcohol outcomes. Results for each health behaviour outcome were selected. Meta-analysis was conducted where possible to calculate standardised mean differences.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred and four studies were eligible for inclusion. Fruit and vegetable intake (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.104; 95 % (CI) (0.03, 0.17)), and sugar-sweetened beverage intake (SMD -0.126; 95 % CI (-0.22, -0.04)) were positively impacted by obesity prevention, as were physical activity (SMD 0.168; 95 % CI (0.05, 0.28)) and sedentary behaviour (SMD -0.021; 95 % CI (-0.03, -0.01)). Findings were mixed for tobacco smoking and alcohol intake.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Independent of weight status, school obesity prevention programs may improve some measures of child dietary intake and physical activity.<h4>Study registration</h4>Prospectively registered: PROSPERO: CRD42021281106.",2025,[],[]
"Impact of Obesity on Immunity to the Influenza Virus: Gut Microbiota, Mechanisms, and Novel Therapeutic Strategies.","Obesity affects millions of individuals globally, and a deeper understanding of its associated physiological disturbances is essential for addressing key public health concerns. It has been demonstrated that the influenza virus possesses substantial global epidemic potential, with higher incidence rates observed in obese individuals and prolonged recovery times. Obese individuals exhibit impaired immune organ function, decreased immune cell activity, disrupted metabolism characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, and an imbalance in gut microbiota associated with intestinal mucosal barrier damage. The gut microbiota and their metabolic composition in obese patients differ from those in non-obese individuals, potentially promoting viral replication and exacerbating disease severity. These factors collectively contribute to more severe tissue damage and heightened immune responses in obese patients during influenza infection. Therefore, understanding the impact of obesity on influenza virus infection dynamics enables the development of strategies promoting healthy lifestyles to manage body weight and enhance immunity against viral infections. Additionally, given that this special population may not respond optimally to antimicrobial drugs and vaccination, it is necessary to consider how treatment strategies for this group are managed.

They are largely distributed in the cytoplasm or localized in exosomes and cannot be easily degraded by RNA exonuclease activity. Their stable expression is broadly observed across eukaryotic species. Insulin resistance (IR) refers to the inability of insulin to exert its normal biological function, as manifested by the impairment of glucose utilization in peripheral tissues (e.g., muscle and fat tissues). IR is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is closely associated with obesity. Recent studies have shown that certain circRNAs play critical roles in obesity-induced diabetes by regulating IR and participating in inflammatory processes. CircRNAs, with their multiple microRNA (miRNA) binding sites, act as miRNA sponges to eliminate the inhibitory actions of miRNAs and up-regulate the expression of target genes. CircRNAs play a significant role in regulating obesity-induced diabetes through their interactions with disease-related miRNAs. In the present study, we explored the biological characteristics of circRNAs and extensively discussed the role of circRNAs in the development of inflammation and IR in adipocytes, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for obesity-induced diabetes. Specific circRNAs (e.g., circARF3 and circ-ZNF609) have been identified as key players in modulating IR and inflammatory responses in adipose tissue. CircRNAs are emerging as important regulators of IR and inflammation in adipocytes, with significant potential for therapeutic intervention in obesity-induced diabetes. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their actions and to explore strategies for targeting circRNAs in clinical applications.",2025,"['r', '##na exonuclease', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'circarf3', 'circ - znf609']",['insulin']
Specific muscle targeted delivery of miR-130a loaded lipid nanoparticles: a novel approach to inhibit lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and obesity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Skeletal muscle lipid deposition is a key manifestation of obesity, often accompanied by decreased exercise capacity and muscle atrophy. Skeletal muscle as the largest organ in the body, makes it challenges for designing targeted drug delivery systems. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used as a safe and efficient delivery carrier, there is limited research on LNPs that specifically target skeletal muscle.<h4>Results</h4>A LNP designed with five specific receptor complements on its surface, which specifically targets skeletal muscle in vivo in mice, without off-target effects on other tissues and organs. MiR-130a, a regulator of PPARG, which is a key factor in skeletal muscle lipid deposition, was encapsulated with LNP (LNP@miR-130a). In high-fat diet (HFD) mice, LNP@miR-130a effectively reduced skeletal muscle lipid deposition, increased exercise activity and enhanced muscle mass. Interestingly, the myokines in skeletal muscle have also changed which may leading to reduce the adipose tissue weight and liver lipid deposition in HFD mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results indicated LNP@miR-130a is a promising inhibitor of skeletal muscle lipid deposition and may help alleviate obesity. This study provides new insights for obesity treatment and lays foundation for the development of targeted skeletal muscle therapeutics.",2025,"['mir - 130a', 'pparg', 'lnp', 'lnp', 'mir - 130a', 'lnp', 'mir - 130a', 'lnp', 'mir - 130a']","['pparg', 'lnp']"
Fiber-specific differences in protein content of pathways related to mTORC1 signaling and oxidative metabolism in individuals with obesity.,"This study aimed to compare the protein content of pathways related to mTORC1 signaling and oxidative metabolism in whole skeletal muscle and isolated muscle fibers from healthy individuals (HEALTHY) and individuals with obesity (OBESE). Muscle biopsies were obtained from 18 individuals. Samples were freeze-dried, and fibers were isolated and fiber-typed for type I and IIa myosin heavy chain isoforms. The protein content of Akt-1, mTOR, p70s6K, S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), ERK1/2, p38, total protein ubiquitination (TPU), and OXPHOS proteins in whole muscle and isolated fibers was determined using immunoblotting. Muscle fiber morphology was also assessed. Fiber type proportion was similar in HEALTHY, while OBESE showed a greater proportion of type IIa fibers. Fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) was similar in HEALTHY, while OBESE showed greater CSA of type I fibers. Protein content of p70s6K was lower (73%, p = 0.008), while ERK1/2 (29%, p = 0.05) and TPU (32%, p = 0.03) were increased in whole muscle from OBESE compared with HEALTHY. Fiber-specific differences were found in p38 (IIa > I, p = 0.03) in HEALTHY, while OBESE showed different complex II and V (I > IIa, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively) between fibers. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between body mass and p70s6K protein content. Our findings suggest that obesity impairs the mTORC1-related protein pathway while increasing degradation in individuals with obesity.",2025,"['mtorc1', 'i and iia', 'myosin heavy chain isoforms', 'akt - 1', 'mtor', 'p70s6k', 's6 ribosomal protein', 's6rp', 'erk1 / 2', 'p38', 'oxphos proteins', 'p70s6k', 'erk1 / 2', 'p38', 'p70s6k', 'mtorc1', 'protein']","['mtorc1', 'myosin heavy chain isoforms', 'mtor', 'p70s6k', 'p38', 'protein']"
"Hyperinsulinemia-induced upregulation of adipocyte TPH2 contributes to peripheral serotonin production, metabolic dysfunction, and obesity.","Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is a rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis. Previously, adipocyte TPH1 has been linked to increased adipose 5-HT, reduced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, and obesity. However, the role of TPH2, a neural isoform highly expressed in obese adipose tissue, is unknown. Here, we report that adipose tissue expression of TPH2 is dramatically elevated in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) and ob/ob mice, as well as in obese humans. In mice fed a high-fat diet, adipocyte TPH2 deficiency improved DIO-induced metabolic complications, enhanced BAT thermogenesis, and increased intestinal energy-harvesting efficiency without affecting adiposity. Conversely, TPH2 overexpression in epididymal adipocytes of chow-fed mice raised adipose and plasma 5-HT levels, suppressed BAT thermogenesis, and exacerbated obesity and metabolic dysfunction. We found that obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia upregulated adipocyte TPH2 expression via activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and SREBP1. In humans, TPH2 mRNA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but not those of TPH1, are positively correlated with fasting plasma insulin concentrations. In summary, our study demonstrates that obesity-associated increases in adipocyte TPH2 can regulate distal tissue physiology and energy metabolism, suggesting that TPH2 could be a potential therapeutic target for obesity and its associated complications.",2025,"['tryptophan hydroxylase', 'tph', 'adipocyte tph1', 'tph2', 'tph2', 'tph2', 'tph2', 'ad', '##yte tph2', 'me', 'target of rapamycin complex 1', 'srebp1', 'tph2 mrna', 'tph1', 'insulin', '##yte', 'tph2', 'tph2']","['tryptophan hydroxylase', 'tph', 'tph2', 'target of rapamycin complex 1', 'srebp1', 'tph1', 'insulin']"
Therapeutic Targeting of the GIP Receptor-Revisiting the Controversies.,"Current and emerging strategies to therapeutically target weight management include pairing agonism of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) with either agonism or antagonism of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR). On the surface, these two approaches seem contradictory, yet they have produced similar effects for weight loss in clinical studies. Arguments that support the rationale for both approaches are made in these point-counterpoint articles, founded on preclinical studies, human genetics, and clinical outcomes. Here, we attempt to reconcile how two opposing approaches can produce similar effects on body weight by evaluating the leading hypotheses derived from the available evidence.",2025,"['glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor', 'glp - 1r', 'glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor', 'gipr']","['glucagon like peptide 1 receptor', 'gipr']"
Central obesity and post-stroke depression: Implications for stroke recovery.,"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a prevalent but often underdiagnosed complication affecting stroke survivors, with significant implications for recovery and quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that central obesity, as measured by the weight-to-waist index (WWI), may play a crucial role in PSD risk and severity. Traditional obesity metrics, such as body mass index, may not accurately capture the impact of visceral fat distribution on neuropsychiatric outcomes. This letter highlights the growing recognition of WWI as a precise indicator of metabolic and inflammatory disturbances linked to post-stroke mental health. Integrating WWI into routine stroke rehabilitation assessments could facilitate early identification of high-risk patients and improve intervention strategies. Further research is needed to establish standardized WWI cutoff values and explore potential therapeutic targets for PSD prevention.",2025,[],[]
The Role of Visfatin in Gastric and Esophageal Cancer: From Biomarker to Therapeutic Target.,"<b>Background:</b> Gastric and esophageal cancers are among the most lethal malignancies worldwide, necessitating improved biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. Visfatin, also known as nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), is a metabolic enzyme and adipokine with emerging significance in cancer progression. It has been implicated in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and chemotherapy resistance, yet its clinical relevance in upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remains unclear. This review aims to explore visfatin's biochemical properties, its role in the pathogenesis of upper GI cancers, and its implications for potential therapeutic interventions. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the role of visfatin in gastric and esophageal cancer. We analyzed studies investigating visfatin expression in tumor tissues, blood, and adipose tissue, its prognostic significance, and its potential as a therapeutic target. Preclinical and clinical studies evaluating visfatin inhibitors were also reviewed. <b>Results</b>: Visfatin promotes tumor progression through the activation of key oncogenic pathways leading to increased angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune suppression. Elevated visfatin levels are associated with advanced tumor stage, reduced response to chemotherapy, and poor prognosis in both gastric and esophageal cancers. Therapeutic agents targeting visfatin, such as the inhibitor FK866, have shown promising results in reducing tumor proliferation by >50%, improving chemoresistance, and restoring antitumor immunity in preclinical studies. However, clinical translation remains limited due to toxicity concerns and the need for more targeted therapies. <b>Conclusions</b>: Visfatin is a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target in gastric and esophageal cancer. However, its precise role and mechanisms require further investigation. The standardization of measurement techniques and large-scale clinical studies is needed to validate its prognostic and predictive value. Future research should focus on optimizing visfatin-targeted therapies, particularly in the context of obesity-associated malignancies and chemoresistant tumors.",2025,"['visfatin', 'nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nampt', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin', 'visfatin']","['visfatin', 'nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nampt']"
The effects of permissive hypercapnia on regional cerebral oxygen saturation and postoperative delirium in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of permissive hypercapnia on regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO<inf>2</inf>) in obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy and its association with the development of delirium.<h4>Methods</h4>In this randomized controlled trial, 83 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomly divided into two groups. Respiratory parameters were adjusted to achieve the target PaCO<inf>2</inf> in each group by pressure-controlled ventilation-volume guaranteed (PCV-VG) mode. In the hypercapnia group, permissive hypercapnia was induced by the lung-protective ventilation strategy, and the target PaCO<inf>2</inf> was set at 50 mmHg, remaining from 45 to 55 mmHg. In the normocapnia group, the target PaCO<inf>2</inf> was set at 40 mmHg, remaining from 35 to 45 mmHg. The changes of rScO<inf>2</inf> were recorded at various times from before induction to the end of surgery. The incidence of cerebral oxygen desaturation events (CDE), and the variables of hemodynamic, respiratory and arterial blood gas were also calculated. Furthermore, the incidence of sub-delirium and delirium, and S100β protein levels were measured within three days after surgery. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) was observed within five days after surgery.<h4>Results</h4>The rScO<inf>2</inf> values in the hypercapnia group during surgery were significantly higher than those in the normocapnia group (P<0.05). Moreover, the incidence of CDE was also significantly lower. There were significant differences in peak inspiratory pressure, lung dynamic compliance, PaCO<inf>2</inf> and pH during surgery. In addition, the outcome of subsyndromal delirium/delirium was significantly lower in the hypercapnia group than that in the normocapnia group (P<0.05). S100β protein levels were also lower in the hypercapnia group within three days after surgery (P<0.05). No difference was found in PPCs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Permissive hypercapnia can enhance cerebral oxygenation and decrease postoperative S100β protein levels in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, which is beneficial for reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium.",2025,"['s100β protein', 's100β protein', 's100β']","['s100beta protein', 's100beta']"
"Shared Determinants of Poor Sleep, Obesity and Adiposity in Adolescents Aged 8-18-Years: A Systematic Review.","Relationships between multiple sleep outcomes, obesity and adiposity across childhood and adolescence have been previously reported. Health-promoting interventions to improve sleep and reduce adolescent obesity could target shared determinants of sleep and obesity. The aim of this systematic review was to systematically identify and examine research that investigated the shared determinants of poor sleep and increased adiposity or obesity in adolescents. A systematic literature search covering publications up to April 2024 was conducted across 10 bibliographic databases. Search terms included objective and subjective sleep/circadian rhythm measurements, objective adiposity measurements and adolescents aged 8-18 years. Eighty studies were included in the final review. Determinants were categorised into three different domains: socioenvironmental determinants, behavioural determinants and health determinants. Shared determinants of poor sleep and increased adiposity or obesity in adolescents aged 8-18 years included: socioenvironmental determinants (gender, ethnicity, pubertal status, academic attainment), behavioural determinants (timing of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), unhealthy diet choices and timing of consumption and screen time and videogaming quantity and timing) and health determinants (wellbeing). These findings suggest that sleep hygiene and the modifiable shared behavioural determinants should be targeted in health-promoting interventions, and statistical analyses should be adjusted for socioenvironmental determinants and wellbeing.",2025,[],[]
Estrogens determine the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in obese males with melanoma.,"Although obesity is a major risk factor for cancer, it may also improve the response to cancer therapy. Here we investigated the impact of obesity on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In male mice, obesity promoted tumor growth but enhanced the response to ICI. This was associated with higher expression of immune-related genes within the tumor and enhanced infiltration of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Further, obesity in mice was associated with higher estrogen levels and enrichment of estrogen response genes in the tumor, and anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) efficacy was reduced upon administration of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, which blocks the production of estrogens. Mechanistically, adipocyte-derived estrogens increased antigen presentation by dendritic cells and tumor-specific CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Last, overweight and obese men with melanoma responded better to ICI, with high estrogen levels being associated with improved response and survival. Our results suggest that estrogens may serve as a predictive factor of response to ICI in men with melanoma.",2025,"['cd8 +', 'anti - programmed cell death 1', 'anti - pd - 1', 'aromatase', 'c', '##d8 +']",['aromatase']
Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome: a narrative review.,"The Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) syndrome is a systemic disorder involving obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease, characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms that interact and lead to increased morbidity and mortality. In recent years, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), as a new class of antidiabetic medications, have shown remarkable efficacy in the management of diabetes, renal and cardiovascular diseases. Research has confirmed their ability to reduce cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. These inhibitors lower blood glucose levels by decreasing renal reabsorption of glucose and sodium, and offer multiple benefits, including lowering blood pressure, reducing body weight, exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects, as well as reducing proteinuria and improving glomerular filtration rate. These effects collectively contribute to the improvement of cardiovascular and renal health. Furthermore, SGLT2i have shown potential therapeutic roles at various stages of CKM syndrome, including improving cardiac function, slowing CKD progression, promoting weight loss, and improving lipid profiles. However, the precise mechanisms of action and off-target effects of SGLT2i still require further investigation to evaluate their efficacy and safety under different clinical conditions. Future research directions should include strategies for multiple disease management, combination therapy effects, interdisciplinary collaboration, and long-term follow-up studies to fully understand and optimize the application of SGLT2i in the treatment of CKM syndrome.",2025,"['sodium - glucose transport protein 2', 'sglt2', 'sglt2', 'sglt2', 'sglt2']",['sglt2']
Potential Application Value of FASN in the Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a crucial enzyme that catalyzes endogenous lipogenesis in multiple diseases. However, the function and significance of FASN in colorectal cancer remain unclear.<h4>Aims</h4>This research aimed to explore the expression and role of FASN in colorectal cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Cancer, adjacent, and normal tissues were collected from patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry and scoring were applied to analyze the expression of FASN in the different tissues, to investigate the differences in its expression among different tissue types, and to examine the potential correlation between FASN and gender, age, BMI, and other factors.<h4>Discussion</h4>In this study, 100 colorectal cancer patients and 100 healthy participants were recruited. Respectively, the average scores of cancer tissues, adjacent tissues, and normal tissues were 7.25, 2, and 1.25. Significant differences were found among these three tissue groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, no significant association was observed between sex, age, BMI, and FASN expression scores in colorectal cancer tissues (<i>p</i> > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based on these data, FASN was specifically overexpressed in cancer tissues and adjacent tissues. Hence, our results suggest that FASN may play an essential role in colorectal cancer and may be an attractive therapeutic target in the future.",2025,"['fatty acid synthase', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn', 'fasn']","['fatty acid synthase', 'fasn']"
"Trends in Social Inequality in Overweight and Obesity Among Danish Infants, 2002-2022.","<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to examine trends in relative and absolute social inequality in overweight/obesity among Danish infants born between 2002 and 2022.<h4>Methods</h4>The study applied yearly cross-sectional data on infants' weight and length at age 6-10 months, n = 63,100. Data was linked with parental education from population registers. Social inequality was measured by OR, relative index of inequality (RII), and slope index of inequality (SII). Trend tests measured changes over time.<h4>Results</h4>No difference in odds for overweight/obesity by parental education was observed between 2002 and 2004, but from 2005 social inequality in overweight/obesity was revealed. The OR for overweight/obesity ranged from 1.20 (95% CI: 0.76-1.89) to 2.31 (95% CI: 1.64-3.25) for infants of parents with lowest educational attainment. RII ranged from 0.78 to 0.41 (test for trend, p = 0.179) and SII ranged from -0.92 to -4.54 (test for trend, p = 0.026) indicating a persistent relative social inequality and an increase in absolute social inequality in overweight/obesity from 2002 to 2022, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The study revealed persistent relative social inequality and increased absolute social inequality in overweight/obesity among Danish infants from 2002 to 2022.",2025,[],[]
"Differences between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity Management: Medical, Social, and Public Health Perspectives.","Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the most urgent global public health challenges, yet differ markedly in recognition and management across medical, social, infrastructure, and policy domains. T2DM is supported by clear diagnostic criteria, defined treatment targets, and broad acceptance as a chronic disease. In contrast, obesity is assessed using imprecise metrics like body mass index, lacks standardized treatment goals, and is often misunderstood as a lifestyle issue rather than a chronic, relapsing disease. This misconception contributes to stigma, discrimination, and unrealistic patient expectations. T2DM receives substantial research funding, comprehensive clinical guidelines, and structured medical education, with strong support from large professional societies and multidisciplinary care models. Obesity care remains underfunded, inconsistently delivered, and underrepresented in medical training. Public health and policy efforts strongly favor T2DM, providing coordinated programs, insurance coverage, and regulatory oversight. Conversely, obesity is marginalized, with limited policy influence and a largely unregulated commercial weight-loss industry. Bridging these disparities requires adopting lessons from T2DM management-such as evidence-based guidelines, improved provider training, expanded insurance coverage, and public health strategies-to enhance obesity care and recognize it as a chronic disease requiring long-term, structured management.",2025,[],[]

Effect of resveratrol and quercetin on SFRP4 as a biomarker of diabesity: In silico and in vivo studies.,"The concurrent presence of complex metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes within an individual is known as diabesity. Various organs are involved in metabolic chronic diseases like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. In the last few years, the rise in diabetes cases has coincided with the rapid elevation in obesity rates, resulting in a global health crisis. Major risk factors playing a critical role in the spread of obesity include high-fat food consumption, high-calorie foods, and insufficient physical activity. Diabetes is strongly linked with obesity in terms of metabolic abnormalities and physiological processes, including inflammation. Diabetes type 2 (T2D) is caused primarily by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin release from beta cells of the pancreas. An obese or overweight individual has a strong association with insulin resistance, which in turn leads to the development of T2D. Metabolic stress due to nutrient overload releases different types of inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α, IL-6, and SFRP4) from adipose tissues in obesity. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is also an inflammatory mediator that impairs insulin secretion. SFRP4 acts as an early biomarker for diabesity expressed with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the adipose tissues that hinders the exocytosis of insulin-secreting granules from the pancreatic β-cells and is a potential target for preserving β-cell dysfunction and the diabesity treatment. In the current study, plant-based phytocompounds were identified and investigated in silico and in vivo for their ability to suppress the expression of SFRP4. In a diet-induced mouse model, short-listed compounds such as resveratrol and quercetin at higher and lower doses were found effective and significant in reducing the anti-inflammatory mediators and SFRP4 levels. Overall, the current study describes the expression of SFRP4, IL-6, and TNF-α, and its inhibition by various inhibitors. Moreover, the study's findings suggest that resveratrol and quercetin hold promise as potential treatments for diabesity.",2025,"['insulin', 'insulin', 'insulin', 'tnf - α', 'il - 6', 'sfrp4', 'frizzled - related protein 4', 'sfrp4', 'insulin', 'sfrp4', 'interleukin - 1 beta', 'il - 1β', 'insulin', 'sfrp4', 'sfrp4', 'sfrp4', 'il - 6', 'tnf - α']","['insulin', 'sfrp4', 'interleukin 1 beta']"
Impact of obesity on low density lipoprotein plasmatic levels 6 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. One of the main factors is obesity, which is on the rise. LDL levels below 0.55 g/L are recommended after ACS. To date, there are no specific recommendations for obese subjects.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary objective was to assess the impact of obesity on LDL-c target attainment 6 weeks after initiation of statin therapy in subjects admitted for ACS. The secondary objectives were to assess the evolution of cholesterol levels and to characterize lipid-lowering treatments.<h4>Methods</h4>The single-center observational study took place at Montpellier University Hospital and included patients admitted to the ICU for ACS not treated with statins (T0). Biological tests were performed at 6 weeks. At 3 months, a telephone call was made by two pharmacists to collect the results of their biological work-up and any therapeutic modifications.<h4>Results</h4>The results were analyzed on 286 patients. A total of 39.5% were overweight and 22.7% obese. After hospitalization, 95.4% were prescribed statins. At 6 weeks, LDL cholesterol averaged 1.58 mmol/L, lower in subjects with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (1.32 mmol/L). On average, 49.46% of subjects reached the LDL cholesterol target, with obese subjects achieving a higher rate of 64.9%. There was no significant difference in the prescription of lipid-lowering treatments between the two groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite high-intensity statin prescription, the target was achieved by 67.6% of obese subjects and 44.8% of subjects with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This shows that post-SCA management needs to be reinforced for the general population.",2025,"['ldl', 'ldl - c', 'statin', 's', 'ldl cholester', 'ldl cholester', 'statin']","['ldl', 'statin']"
Interferon regulatory factor 3 beyond innate immunity: Regulation in obesity and metabolic disorders.,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor known primarily for its role in antiviral immunity via regulation of type I interferons (IFNs). Recent research has broadened its significance to encompass metabolic disorders, particularly obesity and diabetes. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction, all of which are increasingly found to be associated with immune signaling pathways. IRF3 has emerged as an important regulator in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), predominantly through its regulation of inflammatory cytokines production in various cells in adipose tissue. In obese individuals, IRF3 is activated in the adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages, to promote the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to chronic inflammation and exacerbating insulin resistance. Moreover, IRF3 has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatic disorders, further amplifying metabolic stress and imbalances associated with obesity. The growing evidence suggests that IRF3 is an important mediator in both immune and metabolic pathways, highlighting its potential as a target for the development of therapeutic interventions for obesity-related inflammation and metabolic dysfunction.",2025,"['interferon regulatory factor 3', 'irf3', 'type i interferons', 'ifns', 'insulin', 'irf3', '##nes', 'irf3', 'insulin', 'irf3', 'irf3']","['interferon regulatory factor 3', 'irf3', 'type i interferon', 'ifn', 'insulin']"
Circadian Clock Deregulation and Metabolic Reprogramming: A System Biology Approach to Tissue-Specific Redox Signaling and Disease Development.,"Circadian rhythms govern cellular metabolism, redox balance, and endocrine signaling in numerous tissues. However, chronic disturbance of these biological rhythms, mediated by modern lifestyle factors including shift work, sleep irregularity, and prolonged light exposure, has been increasingly associated with oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation, and the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. This review discusses recent mechanistic advances that link circadian misalignment with tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming and impaired proteostasis, focusing on metabolic inflammation and associated pathologies. Emerging work reveals a close interdependence between the circadian clock and proteasome-mediated protein turnover and highlights this interplay's importance in maintaining redox homeostasis. Furthermore, circadian modulation of the activity of the inflammasome complex is suggested to represent an important, but largely unexplored, risk factor in the pathobiology of both malignancy and metabolic syndrome. Recently, researchers have proposed them as novel endocrine regulators of systemic energy balance and inflammation, with a focus on their circadian regulation. In addition, the emerging domains of chrono-epigenetics and tissue-specific programming of the clock pathways may serve to usher in novel therapies through precision medicine. Moving ahead, circadian-based therapeutic approaches, including time-restricted feeding, chronopharmacology, and metabolic rewiring, have high potential for re-establishing physiological domain homeostasis linked to metabolic inflammation pathologies. Elucidating this reciprocal relationship between circadian biology and cellular stress pathways may one day facilitate the generation of precise interventions aiming to alleviate the health burden associated with circadian disruption.",2025,[],[]
Heterogeneous treatment effects of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is on risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes: Insights from a real-world target trial emulation.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study assessed the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).<h4>Methods</h4>This target trial emulation study included adults (≥ 50 years) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and newly prescribed a GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or other second-line glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs). A doubly robust learning approach was deployed to estimate the risk difference (RD) of ADRD and identify key subgroups.<h4>Results</h4>Both GLP-1RAs (RD, -1.5%) and SGLT2is (-1.7%) were associated with a reduced ADRD risk compared to other GLDs. Key subgroups were determined based on cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), chronic kidney disease, and Hispanic ethnicity. Patients with CVD and CeVD had the greatest benefits from GLP-1RAs (-4.8%) and SGLT2is (-4.6%). No overall difference was observed between GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i.<h4>Discussion</h4>These findings suggest the importance of personalized treatment in diabetes management regarding ADRD risk.<h4>Highlights</h4>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), while the protective association varied across subgroups defined by cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) were associated with a decreased risk of ADRD, with the protective association varying among subgroups defined by CVD, CeVD, and Hispanic ethnicity.

Interestingly, FTO is highly expressed and functions as an oncogenic factor in a wide range of cancers. Therefore, using small-molecule inhibitors to target FTO has been established as a promising therapeutic strategy for combating cancers.<h4>Areas covered</h4>Patent literature claiming novel chemical entities as FTO inhibitors disclosed from 2017 to present is available in Espacenet, including dozens of patent documents.<h4>Expert opinion</h4>The pivotal influence of FTO demethylase in a particular epigenetic layer of regulation of gene expression renders it promising for FTO to be a therapeutical target for many diseases, including malignant cancers. Several institutions were prompted and have patented chemical frameworks as FTO inhibitors. Remarkedly, the FTO inhibitor CS1 (Bisantrene) has advanced to clinical trials for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The successful advancement of CS1 into clinical trials would continuingly stimulate researches on RNA epigenetic enzymes targeted first-in-class anticancer drug discovery.",2025,"['obesity - associated protein', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto demethylase', 'fto', 'fto', 'fto', 'cs1', 'cs1']","['fto', 'cs1']"
CXCL2: a key player in the tumor microenvironment and inflammatory diseases.,"CXCL2 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2), a constituent of the C-X-C chemokine subfamily, serves as a powerful chemotactic factor for neutrophils, facilitating leukocyte recruitment and movement while initiating an inflammatory response. Recent investigations have demonstrated the pivotal involvement of CXCL2 in carcinogenesis. Within the tumor microenvironment, CXCL2 modulates cellular activity primarily via its interaction with the CXCR2 receptor. The activation of signaling pathways, including ERK/MAPK, NF-κB/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT3, highlights CXCL2's inclination to promote tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the role of CXCL2 encompasses inflammatory conditions like lung inflammation, atherosclerosis, and obesity. This article examines the structural characteristics, biological roles, and molecular foundation of CXCL2 in carcinogenesis and inflammatory disorders.",2025,"['cxcl2', 'c - x - c motif chemokine ligand 2', 'c - x - c chemokine subfamily', 'cxcl2', 'cxcl2', 'cxcr2 receptor', 'erk', 'mapk', 'nf - κb', 'mapk', 'pi3k', 'a', '##kt', 'jak', 'stat3', 'cxcl2', 'cxcl2', 'cxcl2']","['cxcl2', 'cxcr2 receptor', 'erk', 'mapk', 'pi3k', 'jak', 'stat3']"
"Extracellular DNA, hyaluronic acid, HIF pathways, and LncRNAs as predictive biomarkers of severe COVID-19.","The clinical course of COVID-19 ranges from mild symptoms to severe complications, and common laboratory markers such as D-dimer, ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) often do not accurately predict which patients will develop severe disease. In this study, we reviewed current literature and analyzed additional data to assess emerging biomarkers that may help identify high-risk cases earlier. These include circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) produced during neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), hyaluronic acid (HA), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) isoforms, and related long non-coding RNAs such as HAS2-AS1 and HIF1-AS1. Increased levels of cfDNA/NETs, HA, and elevated expression of HIF isoforms and their lncRNAs are closely associated with key features of severe COVID-19, including immune-related blood clotting, low oxygen levels, vascular damage, and chronic inflammation. These biomarkers show promise for use in risk assessment tools that could support earlier clinical decisions and improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19.",2025,"['ferritin', 'interleukin - 6', 'il - 6', 'c - reactive protein', 'crp', 'hypoxia - inducible factor', 'hif', 'has2 - as1', 'hif1 - as1', 'hif is']","['ferritin', 'interleukin 6', 'c reactive protein', 'crp', 'hif']"

Effect of tirzepatide-induced weight loss on adipose tissue in obesity: rationale and design of the randomized placebo-controlled Tirzepatide Brown and Beige Adipose Tissue Activation (TABFAT) trial.,"<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is a complex disease marked by excessive, dysfunctional adipose tissue accumulation. Recent research underscores the pivotal role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in metabolic health and its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity management. Emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that second-generation anti-obesity drugs, especially dual agonists such as tirzepatide, may enhance BAT activity. Additionally, beige adipose tissue, derived from white adipose tissue (WAT), may contribute significantly to whole-body thermogenesis, yet its role remains underexplored.<h4>Methods</h4>This investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to evaluate the effects of tirzepatide on BAT activity and WAT browning in premenopausal women with obesity. Thirty-four participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either tirzepatide or a placebo for 24 weeks. Primary outcomes include changes in BAT volume and activity, assessed using 18F-FDG-PET/CT, MRI, and infrared thermography, as well as the induction of WAT browning, evaluated through changes in mRNA expression patterns and histomorphometric alterations in subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. Secondary outcomes will involve the assessment of whole-body composition, resting energy expenditure, and various metabolic health markers, correlated with thermogenic adipose tissue changes. Comparative analysis of BAT assessment methods will refine protocols for research and clinical use.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study is the first to systematically explore the potential of pharmacological obesity management to enhance BAT activity and induce WAT browning. Results may establish thermogenic adipose tissue augmentation as a novel mechanism of action for second-generation anti-obesity medications.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06893211.
